attend the Fancy Food Show and launch Dagoba, an organic-chocolate company. Schilling had just turned thirty, Holderman was twenty-nine, and the show was the first entrepreneurial event of their lives. Dagoba had no employees and no orders. It had a lease for a ground-floor industrial space in Boulder, Colorado (the “factory”), and an investment of twenty thousand dollars (borrowed from Schilling’s mother and an uncle), which, after flights, a hotel, and a fee for the smallest possible booth, against a dark wall in the basement of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, was gone. It also had “launch products”—seven bars, including infusions of raspberry and mint—an amateurish jamboree, confected and poured into molds by a man who had never liked chocolate, hand-wrapped by a woman who rarely ate more than two ounces a year, and tested only by their Boulder friends and roommates, a scraggly crew of ski bums and folksingers. Dagoba was more bedroom than boardroom. In New York, that changed.</p><div class="consumer-marketing-unit consumer-marketing-unit--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit--no-failsafe"><div class="consumer-marketing-unit__slot consumer-marketing-unit__slot--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit__slot--in-content"></div></div><p>“I was overwhelmed,” Holderman told me. “The magnitude of the show, the number of other chocolate companies—I had no idea.” Their venture had begun a few months earlier, on Valentine’s Day. Holderman and Schilling were on a chairlift, skiing in the Arapahoe Basin, when Schilling said he could wait no longer (“I need to do this now!”). He raced down, shopped, got home, melted two batches of organic chocolate, infusing one with milk chai, the other with raspberries and rose hips, poured them into heart-shaped molds, and served them on a silver platter to the hundred friends who came over for a party that went on till the next morning, with guests naked in a hot tub, “praying for peace,” as a red sun brightened the Continental Divide.</p><p>The Fancy Food Show runs for three days. By the end, Holderman and Schilling’s samples had disappeared in a bewildering thirty-six-hour gobblefest, their picture taken so often that they felt like celebrities—the boyfriend-girlfriend team with wacky organics—and Schilling, a self-described alchemist, entered the happiest period of his life. He became a chocolate-maker.</p><div class="ad ad--in-content"><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"></div></div><p>I found Schilling at this year’s show slumped uncomfortably in a plastic chair. His face was in a cup of coffee, absorbing steam. He was wearing an oversized floppy cotton shirt, the top buttons undone, a hairy chest on display, jeans, clogs, a discolored shiny leather bracelet. He was wolverine thin, with an unshaven scratchy face, sagging cheeks, and soft round sacks under his eyes, and his breath smelled so powerfully of red wine from the night before that a staff member gave him two sticks of cinnamon gum. He had just returned from a trip to Bali, Java, and Sulawesi, including a stint in the tropical backcountry, and he kept running a hand through his hair, as if to make sure that a soft-tissue creature hadn’t made a home there. He wasn’t on a New York clock yet, he explained, but realized, counting slowly, that he’d been here five days. He looked up, perplexed, his eyes so red they could have been rubbed with sand.</p><p>Schilling is thirty-six, no longer a novice but still not the obvious founder of a manufacturing company with many millions of dollars in sales. His education has been scattershot. He applied to one college, St. John’s in New Mexico, didn’t get in, prepared to enter a monastery, and, at the last minute, was offered a scholarship by Ohio Wesleyan to play lacrosse. (“I love lacrosse!”) He intended to study religion, hoping to satisfy a spiritual need, but, in the summer, attended a music festival “in the sacred valley of Telluride” and never returned. He worked for a record store, the sum of his business experience. He played guitar. He wrote songs, smoked “an insane amount of herbal blends,” and was the lead singer in a band. After six years, he moved to Boulder, but, fundamentally, his life never changed.</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-1 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>At the show, Schilling and I walked past the French chocolates of Michel Cluizel and saw a photograph of the white-haired patriarch surrounded by his offspring: four scrawny young adults, each assigned to a different division of the business. Dagoba is an inverted version. Schilling has no children, but his mother, a soft-spoken sixty-one-year-old divorcée, looks after the front office. She was running the stand that morning. An older sister, unmarried, keeps the books. And his father, a misanthropic ex-I.B.M. corporate manager, retired at forty-nine (“So I could golf, drink beer, bowl, and play blackjack at Indian casinos,” he told me), was summoned one weekend to give lessons in how to run a business and stayed for years. “How do I travel so much?” Schilling said. “I’ve got Papa Jon nearby, Sister Becky doing the accounts, and Mother Mary working the phones.” He beamed. His smile was disarming because it was so trusting, confident that the affection it conveyed would be reciprocated, and his manner, despite the hangover and the slouch and the exhaustion, was irrepressibly cheerful. “<em>Theobroma cacao</em>,” he exhaled—the scientific name given to chocolate by Linnaeus—stretching out his arms as though to embrace his products in a loving hug. “<em>Theos</em>, god. <em>Broma</em>, food. The food of the gods.”</p><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">In the past five years, dark chocolate has had astonishing sales, especially in the United States, and has grown ten times faster than milk chocolate. In 2006, its sales increased by fifteen per cent. Dark chocolate represents a quarter of what Americans buy, four billion dollars last year, and industry analysts, who believe that sales will reach nearly five and a half billion by 2011, don’t see an end. One says that it “will drive the chocolate sector for the next hundred years.” An appreciation of dark chocolate is now a sign of a discriminating palate. Most chocolate has no such pretensions. It ends up in a candy bar or a chocolate Easter egg or an M&amp;M-like treat referred to by the trade as “bagged product.” But taste is a powerful force—in effect, “taste” is “culture”—which I hadn’t fully understood until Schilling introduced me to his high-end hands-on fellow-manufacturers.</p><p>They were uniformly earnest. They told no jokes. They seemed to have no interest in selling, wanting to talk only about what they made, bars invariably (anything else—a filled confection like a truffle, for instance—was frivolous), in the compulsive, insistent way that upmarket vintners go on about their wines. The intellectual index was the wrapper, the compact culinary encyclopedia of what was inside. It might tell you where the beans came from. (Madagascar is this year’s hot real estate.) It might reveal the varietal. One of the rarest is a Porcelana, from South America; Amedei, an Italian company, sells it for a hundred and twenty-seven dollars a pound. There were “crus,” named after specific farms. Some bars had a harvest year. I got one from an Internet supplier, a 2002, made from Chuao Valley beans in Venezuela, three years past its sell-by date. Suspecting a gimmick, I ate it to confirm its staleness. I was surprised. It seemed fresher than other bars I’d bought. If kept dry, a chocolate with a high cacao content, I’ve discovered, rarely spoils.</p></div><div class="grid--item grid-layout__aside"><aside class="persistent-aside" style="position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto"><div class="sticky-box"><div class="sticky-box__primary"><div class="ad ad--rail"><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--rail"></div></div></div><div class="sticky-box__placeholder"></div></div></aside></div></div><div class="row full-bleed-ad"><div class="ad ad--mid-content"><span class="ad-label">Advertisement</span><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--mid-content"></div></div></div><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><div class="grid--item body body__container article__body grid-layout__content"><p>The cacao content is a wrapper’s most important datum, and the acceptable benchmark is seventy per cent. The figure is a measure of “cocoa mass.” (The English language uses “cacao,” the Mayan word for the tree, and “cocoa,” an eighteenth-century corruption, interchangeably.) The mass is what you get after you grind up the beans, a gooey wet gob. I did this at home. I put old, dry beans in a coffee grinder, and was surprised by the amount of liquid they produced. It is fat, a lot of it, half the bean’s content, although the fat is mainly unsaturated, the kind that’s good for you, like an avocado’s. This benchmark figure is now the heart of contemporary dark-chocolate culture. It provides a confederation of obsessives with a name, “the seventy-per-cent club” (pure chocolate, “no bonbons”)—the snobbiest of the snobby, according to Schilling. It is the number on most of the chocolates I saw. Amedei’s Porcelana is seventy per cent. So is an Ocumare Grand Cru, an award-winning new product, named after a Venezuelan valley unknown to anyone except other fanatics.</p><p>I tasted it with Schilling. His face gave little away. “Good chocolate,” he said finally.</p><p>I had a bite and thought: Harmonic, pure.</p><p>“Expensive beans,” he added, quietly. “But good.” He had another bite. “In fact,” he declared, “this is very good.” It was too emphatic. I wondered if he had a reservation he wasn’t expressing, maybe out of respect to the maker, Art Pollard. In 1996, Pollard had a midlife cacao epiphany and has been on a quest for perfect chocolate ever since. This was one of his three products. It might be years before he produced another. I studied him: pale skin, soft middle, a wife he never sees, talking, talking, talking. His life was this bar.</p><p>Schilling took me to the Valrhona stand, the French maker, and we tasted a Guanaja, named after a Caribbean island where chocolate was first seen by a European. Columbus, on his last voyage, in 1502, came upon a dugout canoe filled with brown beans, clearly regarded by their Mayan crew as precious: everyone panicked when some spilled. But Columbus, eager to get on, dismissed them as strange almonds. Valrhona’s Guanaja was the world’s first seventy-per-cent bar, the chocolate world’s equivalent of an airplane’s breaking the sound barrier. It was released in 1986, after two years of secret testing by pastry chefs and tastings and retastings by a Valrhona jury. Before the Guanaja, most dark chocolate was half sugar, a so-called bittersweet confection.</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-2 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>Since then, Valrhona has followed the same studied approach in launching any new bar. It was founded in 1924 and has ten basic bars. El Rey, founded in 1929, has nine bars. Scharffen Berger has six. The message: serious chocolate is a considered business.</p><p>Schilling has twenty-nine bars. He has his dark bars, like everyone else—a New Moon (seventy-four per cent), a darker moon (the Eclipse, eighty-seven per cent), and the hundred-per-cent Prima Materia, the refined version of what I produced with my coffee grinder, a brick of intensely complex flavors that can be eaten only in small quantities over a long period. But mainly he has whatever occurs to him. “This seventy-per-cent thing is a health craze, not a flavor craze. I’ve had seventy-per-cent bars that I wouldn’t put in my compost pile. Does anyone have any idea what these percentages mean?</p><p>“I want surprises in my chocolate,” he explained. “I don’t want purity. I like peaks and valleys. Good beans, bad ones, the perfect and the flawed. Today, everyone wants the established names, the Ocumares, the Madagascars. I like getting in the truck and driving sixteen hours to a village that hasn’t replaced its original stock with the latest hybrid. Every bean is a story.”</p><p>Schilling doesn’t have the patience to conduct tastings over two years. “I prepare a flavor in my mind. Once it’s there, I can make the actual physical object quickly.” An idea occurs to him, invariably at night (“Bottles of red wine essential”), he realizes it in the morning (knife, toaster oven, spice grinder), and manufactures it in a week. He knows one appetite, one curiosity, and one palate: his own.</p><p>“What do I want from a chocolate?” he asked. “A beginning and an end. I start with the breast of a woman on her back.” He illustrated with his hand how a breast flattens when a woman lies down. “That’s my flavor curve. You start with the belly.” He used his forefinger like a pencil. “You then move up her body, climbing slowly, rising up the flattened curve of the breast, gently, and the nipple pops out suddenly. Have you noticed how a woman’s nipple pops out when she is on her back? Then you slide down, an elegant finish.” He looked at me. “It always comes back to sex.”</p><p>He also makes tinctures: “Clarity” for mornings, “Moon Cycle” for a woman’s period, and “Eros,” a constellation of every tribal moonbeam fringe aphrodisiac he could find. It was foul; it tasted like a drug store. I asked Schilling if he used it. “Oh, yes.” He cited an ingredient, damiana, that he once mixed into a chocolate served at a party. He won’t do that again. “People were having sex on a couch.”</p><p>I stared at the bottle. You took it in a dropper.</p><p>“We don’t sell a lot of these here in New York,” Schilling said. “It’s probably a West Coast thing.”</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-3 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>He has three drinking chocolates—he brushes his teeth with the unsweetened one—and recently experimented with another, made from raw seeds. I didn’t know that this wasn’t done—that flavors aren’t really created until a seed has been fermented and dried—until I tried it. It was like black dirt. Why make a drink that tastes disgusting?</p><p>“Antioxidants,” he said. “The benefits are frickin’ off the charts. But most never even make it into the product.” He offered an example: “Dutching,” a process developed in 1828 by Coenraad van Houten, a Dutch chemist. The fats in chocolate are notoriously temperamental and don’t like water, and the drink had always been grainy. Van Houten figured out how to squeeze out most of the fats with a heavy press, and then pulverize the cakey leftovers into a powder: better, but still silty. He then added an alkaline, sodium carbonate, and rendered the smooth modern cocoa. But alkaline destroys antioxidants.</p><p>“You will never understand cacao until you see it in the tropics,” Schilling said one day. He mentioned Diego Badaró, a “spiritual brother” who farms it in the rain forests of Brazil. We should go to Bahia, Schilling proposed. And I agreed.</p><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">A few weeks later, Badaró at the wheel of a Land Rover, Schilling and I entered cacao country at five in the morning, an hour before a tropical dawn revealed green, foggy wet hills, the landscape of the Mata Atlântica, the rain forest of the Brazilian coast. A banner of welcome was stretched above the road, Highway 101. We’d been driving south for six hours, having set out from Salvador, Bahia’s capital. We ate cacao beans to stay awake. We stopped at a twenty-four-hour tapioca stand. We passed a muddy market square, with posts to tie your horse. A monkey ran across the road.</p></div><div class="grid--item grid-layout__aside"><div class="sticky-box"><div class="sticky-box__primary"><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="" class="recirc-most-popular-wrapper viewport-monitor-anchor"></div></div><div class="sticky-box__placeholder"></div></div></div></div><div class="row full-bleed-ad"><div class="ad ad--mid-content"><span class="ad-label">Advertisement</span><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--mid-content"></div></div></div><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><div class="grid--item body body__container article__body grid-layout__content"><p>“<em>Jupara</em>,” Badaró said.</p><p><em>Jupara</em> was the mythic animal that introduced cacao to the rain forests here. It is said to have entered Bahia bearing a pod, which it broke open, eating the pulp, discarding the seeds, and sowing the first tree, having run from the Amazon Basin, two thousand miles away. Most botanists believe the fruit originated in the Amazon, and they continue to find new varieties there—more than anyone can count, each an expression of a unique micro-rain-forest spot. Bahia is the Amazon’s geographical next-of-kin: the same climate, forest canopy, diverse floor. But there is no wild cacao; the tree was introduced, most likely by a Frenchman, Louis Frederick Warneaux, who, in 1746, sowed seeds near one of Bahia’s large rivers.</p><p>By then, the fruit, which grows in the shade in warm, wet latitudes—the “twenty-twenty zone”—had migrated from the Amazon Basin, adapting and cross-pollinating along the way, west and north through Venezuela, Panama, southern Mexico, where it was cultivated by a succession of Mesoamerican civilizations. The Olmecs, on the Gulf Coast, were the first, around 1300 B.C. They called it <em>kakawa</em>. You still find semi-wild trees in Mexico’s humid lowlands, and some of the world’s fruitier blond-brown chocolate comes from family holdings there. Mayans were next. By 1519, when Hernán Cortés and his army attended an Aztec feast on the island capital of Tenochtitlán (now Mexico City) and witnessed the seed in a beverage, cacao was a profoundly sophisticated food.</p><p>The Spaniards had seen nothing like it. The “beans,” as dried seeds were called, were roasted over a fire; crushed into a paste; flavored with flowers, chilies, black pepper, and vanilla; diluted with cold water; poured between vessels until a froth formed; and served in a lacquered gourd, by a train of solemnly reverent women, to Motecuhzoma Xocoyotzin. Montezuma drank it all night—fifty cups, by one account—and <em>cacahuatl</em>, when later presented in Europe as <em>chocolatl</em>, would have two specific associations arising out of the high theatre of its introduction: as an élitist food (only the ruler drank it) and an erotic one (the suggestive female attendants). It had more rarefied associations among the Aztecs. For them, it was a divine food: the gift of a deity, Quetzalcóatl, and used in the worship of Xochiquetzal, a fertility goddess. It was consumed at births, sacrifices, and funerals. It was a trading currency—three beans bought you a fresh avocado, one an overripe one—and hoarded in storehouses. (Nine hundred and sixty million beans were counted in one stash, according to Sophie and Michael Coe in their “True History of Chocolate,” the best account of cacao in Mesoamerica.) The Aztecs couldn’t grow it—they had the wrong climate—and, like others, depended on colonies of rain-forest farmers.</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-4 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>Among them were the Kekchi Mayans, in Guatemala. In 1544, a group was invited to Spain by Dominican priests and, in an audience with Prince Philip, the future king, made Europe’s first recorded chocolate drink. Commercial shipments began in 1585, arriving in Seville, and by the early sixteen-hundreds the beverage—the Aztec preparation, served warm, with European flavorings (sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg)—had its own high-society rituals, including ornate serving vessels and a <em>molinillo</em>, a stirrer to make the froth. The beans were probably from Guatemala, the blond-brown variety prized today. Spaniards call it <em>criollo</em>, the “native.”</p><p>In London, the first chocolate shop opened, on Gracechurch Street, in 1657. Two private clubs, White’s and the Garrick, got their start as chocolate houses. By 1664, when Pepys was writing about the new beverage (“To Mr. Blands and there drank my morning draught in good Chocolatte, and slabbering my band sent home for another”), he was a representative European consumer. He didn’t understand what he was drinking, had no idea how it was made, and knew only that it came from the New World and that he wanted as much as he could get. In the face of a global shortage, an equatorial panic set in, and prospectors and opportunists fanned out across the tropics, looking for wild trees and planting new ones. Spaniards started finding a darker, more bitter variety in South America, an immigrant cousin of the Amazon Basin’s original bean, which they called <em>forastero</em>, the “newcomer.” By the end of the seventeenth century, the Spanish had found trees in Venezuela and Ecuador. They planted some in Trinidad, the French planted in Martinique, the English in Jamaica. Jesuits finally discovered the original <em>forastero</em> along the Amazon, the wild breed that had started everything, an astonishing bounty. But it was deep in the backcountry, and their harvest often rotted before reaching a port.</p><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">The Rio de Contas, a wide, almost deltalike river, was startling, a sudden big sky and a feeling of openness, and very bright. It was noisy with birds. The rain forest houses most of the earth’s plant and animal population. I hadn’t anticipated it would be so loud. The effect was unexpectedly welcoming: you felt isolated but not alone. Badaró’s property was called Monte Alegre, and was some miles away. The road was flooded, not really a road but a shallow bog, with giant holes that seemed deep enough to sink the vehicle. The air smelled of burning wet wood. We passed a house, once white, now moldy black and fighting off the forest, its front door long gone, five small children in front, a cloying, damp smoke coming out of a chimney. We passed another, with a sliding roof, the drying area for cacao beans, built to close up when it rained. There were monkeys, hawks, and toucans. There were pigs, chickens, and a mule. An old man was out for a hunt, followed by his wife. He looked cantankerous and unhopeful, carrying a musket and a bag of homemade ammunition.</p><p>The road climbed a hill. A cacao plantation is a <em>fazenda</em>, and four hundred acres seemed large enough to fit the American sense of the word. But most of it was thick and impenetrable, cacao trees scattered throughout. It seemed to invert normal real-estate economics: <em>not</em> to use the land efficiently.</p><p>Badaró stopped the vehicle at his gate and got out. He was wearing high black boots and forest-green rain gear. He was tall, with some bulk, and had thick eyebrows and jet-black hair, parted in the middle. A machete was strapped to his belt. He was twenty-six but had the deliberate, unexcitable manner of an older man, and a deep baritone, referred to by his family as “the voice.” He used it to speak to officials. In his bearing, he could have been sixty, with a dozen children. Instead, he had a thirty-four-year-old stepson. His wife, Luiza, a dark-haired artist, was fifty-five, the same age as his mother.</p><p>He had eccentricities. On the journey down, he had turned off the headlights—despite curves, blind hilltops, other vehicles—in order to see the stars better. He drove at bewildering speed. He lost control once, the Land Rover snapping back and forth in a succession of extreme hydroplaning skids. He often prayed: to Ewa, a god of serpents; to Oxossi, the hunter god (Badaró’s personal deity); and to a dozen others, West African in origin. One night, I accompanied him to a worship service in Salvador—an airless room, chanting, drums, members working themselves into a trance, throwing themselves about, jabbering—and met his mother, Katia. A warrior woman—helmet, dagger, breastplate—grabbed Badaró, made battle cries, and grunted.</p></div><div class="grid--item grid-layout__aside"><div class="sticky-box"><div class="sticky-box__primary"><div class="ad ad--rail"><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--rail"></div></div></div><div class="sticky-box__placeholder"></div></div></div></div><div class="row full-bleed-ad"><div class="ad ad--mid-content"><span class="ad-label">Advertisement</span><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--mid-content"></div></div></div><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><div class="grid--item body body__container article__body grid-layout__content"><p>At the <em>fazenda</em>, Schilling spotted the first cacao. It was like a toy football, green and unripe, attached to a tree trunk as though it had been stapled on: a hulking pod defying gravity and seeming to invite you to take a swipe at it. He saw more, full-sized footballs, bright yellow, mainly, but also red and orange-yellow, looking even more preposterously pendulant.</p><p>Badaró twisted a pod off a trunk and lopped off the top with his machete. The inside was creamy wet. It smelled of honey and orange and perfume. This was the pulp surrounding the giant seeds. The seeds looked like wet white maggots. Nothing suggested chocolate. Badaró stuck his fingers inside, pulled out some seeds, and tipped them into my hand, and I ate them. They had a slimy, sweet zing, more liquid than substance, and as I rubbed them against the roof of my mouth the pulp disintegrated. I was left with four seeds—still a mouthful. I bit one gently. It was bitter, awful. I spit it out.</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-5 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>The spitting is everything. Cacao has peculiar rain-forest dependency. If the pod is not removed, it shrivels and the seeds die. It needs to tempt whatever happens by—monkey, man, squirrel, rat—to stop, wrestle it off its stubby stalk, break it, drink the nectar, eat the pulp (or try to), and cough out the seeds. No creature likes the seeds; the fruit’s future is in its immediate ejection. The seeds that end up on the rain-forest floor sprout within hours of exposure to the air.</p><p>Badaró lopped off another pod. I raised it over my head like a canteen, hoping to get a taste of <em>miel de cacao</em>, the honey. It is what remains after the seeds have been drained, but it keeps for no more than a day. You never see it outside the twenty-twenty zone. In Bahia, it is a specialty, drunk in the shade of the trees that made it.</p><p>We climbed back into the vehicle and followed a two-track road into the trees, where we found four men sitting on the ground, surrounded by yellow fruits, thwacking them rhythmically with their machetes, digging out the pulp, and tossing the empty pods to the side. The pulp was heaped into a white, gooey mound, and a viscous liquid trickled down into a receptacle. Badaró poured some of it into a discarded pod.</p><p>It had the same bright citrus flavor that made the pulp so startling. How could there be citrus notes? I identified acidity and sugar; I thought of grapefruit, qualities associated with a sun-ripened fruit: a translucent skin, exposure to direct light. But a cacao pod has a white, inch-thick shell, like a chunk of Styrofoam.</p><p>Badaró poured more into my gourd. It seemed to balance sweetness and acidity, weight and liquidity, mouthfeel and perfume; if not universal in its appeal, it was clearly irresistible to all but a few palates. In effect, the tree had made a monkey out of me so I could help it along by spitting out the seeds.</p><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">In Bahia, the cacao business started slowly because the rewards came so slowly: you stuck a sapling into a wild, uninhabited land and waited. It might be ten years before you saw money from the fruit. Offspring of the Frenchman’s first tree may have been growing since the eighteenth century, but no cacao was harvested until the demand from Europe was great enough to make the labor worthwhile. By the middle of the nineteenth century, the Dutch had reinvented chocolate as a beverage, and the cacao butter extracted in the process had been used by the Cadbury brothers, in England, to make their first bar.</p><p>By 1850, chocolate was being made in factories, on a much larger scale. By then, farmers in Bahia had developed the <em>cabruca</em> system, a way of cultivating a wild tree in a wild forest by thinning out the understory—trunks, dwarf palms, vines—planting in the cleared space, and preserving the canopy for protection: the rain forest disturbed but basically intact. (The earth is almost sterile; nutrition comes from the trees.) By then, the Bahians also recognized that their harvest had a better chance of reaching port than anything hauled out of the Amazon. The forest wasn’t less impenetrable; it just grew right up to the sea, and deep rivers led out of it.</p><p>But it wasn’t easy, even by 1920, as Roy Nash, an ex-army adventurer, observed in the three years he spent in the region. On a visit to a cacao plantation on the Rio de Contas, Nash came across an Olympian effort: a gang of workers driving mule-led pack trains, trying to get their harvest to a rail depot and then to port, “troop after troop struggling with their precious cargoes through mud that ate the very heart out of the beasts and through water that ate much cash value out of the beans. Two days to the railroad, two days back, two weeks for the animals to recuperate!” Nash’s account, “The Conquest of Brazil” (1926), is a rare contemporary document of what was becoming an unusually secretive land visited by few foreigners, mainly because, as Nash saw firsthand—in flight from a cacao gang of two hundred “with Winchesters across their saddles”—this giant territory was simply not governed. He witnessed a shooting at a dance, a stabbing on a train, a private army stopping an election, another in a battle with the governor’s troops, a gangster’s “game of raid, rape, and run,” hired gunmen, and “colonels” everywhere—landowners entitled to make their own laws and enforce them with armed deputies.</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-6 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>By then, Badaró’s family had been producing cacao for thirty years. The family knows nothing of the first Brazilian Badaró, except that he was born in Sicily and arrived in the eighteen-fifties. Of the second generation, they know of a son, Antônio, a man of visionary industry, who cleared the understory along the Rio Almada, twenty miles of a famously fertile tract where cacao thrives, and planted millions of trees. We drove over the river during the night. By the time Antônio passed the enterprise on to his oldest sons, Juca, Senhor, and Domingos, it was one of the largest in Brazil, hundreds of thousands of acres on one bank. Another family, the Oliveiras, were on the opposite bank.</p><inline-embed childTypes="image" name="feature-default"><figure class="asset-embed"><div class="asset-embed__asset-container"><span class="responsive-asset asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-asset--invisible"><picture class="asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image"><noscript><img alt="Diego Badar and Frederick Schilling." class="responsive-image__image" src="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5909322ec14b3c606c10296e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/071029_r16568e_p646.jpg" srcSet="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5909322ec14b3c606c10296e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/071029_r16568e_p646.jpg 1600w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5909322ec14b3c606c10296e/master/w_1280%2Cc_limit/071029_r16568e_p646.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5909322ec14b3c606c10296e/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/071029_r16568e_p646.jpg 1024w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5909322ec14b3c606c10296e/master/w_768%2Cc_limit/071029_r16568e_p646.jpg 768w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5909322ec14b3c606c10296e/master/w_640%2Cc_limit/071029_r16568e_p646.jpg 640w" sizes="100vw"/></noscript></picture></span></div><figcaption class="caption asset-embed__caption caption-shade--light"><span class="caption__text"><p>Diego Badaró and Frederick Schilling.</p>
</span></figcaption></figure></inline-embed><p>Now there was not enough cacao in the world to meet demand. Chocolate had become a wholly different food—a mass-market global confection—because a way had been found to make it with milk, previously impossible, owing to the fats’ absolute intolerance of anything with water in it. (People had been trying to mix chocolate and milk since cacao beans arrived in Seville; the model was probably coffee.) The trick was in manipulating the boiling point. In 1867, Henri Nestlé, in Vevey, on Lake Geneva, trying to create an infant formula that wouldn’t spoil, put milk in a sealed container, removed the air with a crude pump, and heated it until the water content evaporated. In a vacuum, milk boils at a lower temperature and doesn’t curdle. Nine years later, Daniel Peter, the town’s chocolate manufacturer, fed the formula to a newborn baby and understood an essential implication: a dried milk would not be rejected in cacao. Chocolate now had a populist formulation, its intensity diluted and dulled by sweet fats. It was an indulgence (fat + fat + sugar) and it was cheap (because milk was the principal ingredient), and by the time Peter’s Chocolate won a gold medal at an Amsterdam exhibition in 1883, people couldn’t get enough of it. By 1901, Peter’s Chocolate had a U.S. distributor and an unobstructed horizon to expand to. No American had figured out the boiling trick, although many tried, including Milton Hershey, whose milk kept curdling, until finally, after years of experiments, Hershey settled for what he could get: milk chocolate that was slightly soured but not entirely ruined. (To this day, American milk chocolate makes Europeans gag.) By 1905, Juca, Senhor, and Domingos were running Antônio’s estate. The same year, Hershey opened his new chocolate factory.</p></div><div class="grid--item grid-layout__aside"><div class="sticky-box"><div class="sticky-box__primary"><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="" class="recirc-most-popular-wrapper viewport-monitor-anchor"></div></div><div class="sticky-box__placeholder"></div></div></div></div><div class="row full-bleed-ad"><div class="ad ad--mid-content"><span class="ad-label">Advertisement</span><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--mid-content"></div></div></div><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><div class="grid--item body body__container article__body grid-layout__content"><p>The sons had never seen a northern chocolate factory. They didn’t know how to make chocolate. They didn’t eat it. But they had seen booms before: a raw resource is discovered (diamonds, gold, rubber) and is wanted on the other side of the earth—and many people had become rich. Even the Rio de Contas had been mined for diamonds. Cacao was just the next thing. There was a rush to get to Bahia before others got there first.</p><p>In twenty years, the region went from producing almost none of the world’s cacao to most of it. Ilhéus—a provincial port in 1885 (sugar, coffee, timber)—became a boom town, with gaudy baroque mansions, cacao barons, night life, a celebrity prostitute, towering warehouses, harbor congestion, brokers, lawyers, tax inspectors, the agencies and excesses of sudden wealth.</p><p>All of this appears in the work of Jorge Amado, the region’s chronicler. Amado’s family moved to Ilhé-us in 1914, when he was two, after a major flood destroyed their plantation; he died in 2001, at eighty-eight, after generating thirty-two books, seven movies, and a soap opera watched by twenty-five million. At the heart of Amado’s region is the high drama of a flawed squatter’s right: all property had been acquired by possessing, then defending—possibly a reasonable practice in 1850, definitely a dangerous one later, when desperate arrivals believed chocolate would make them rich. Claims had been filed at the Cartório de Ofícios, in Itabuna. Between 1905 and 1910, it burned down: no records, anarchy, and everyone at war with everyone else. It was rebuilt; new claims were received; it burned down again. Cacao made Amado into a writer—and in an introduction to “The Violent Land” (1943) he expresses his debt. He doesn’t thank the Badaró family, although it is their stories he tells, using their real names, a dizzying feature to come upon for the first time, as if the novel were a history, and maybe it is. The Badarós, too, were at war. Their adversaries were the family across the river.</p><p>At Monte Alegre, Badaró revealed that he had learned of a ninety-three-year-old Oliveira survivor, his head and neck still laced with hacking scars. He had retained a heavy bell that had been rung when his home was under attack, and he still spat when he heard his rivals’ family name. We made an effort to visit him—Badaró nervous, gravely imagining a reconciliation across generations—and then discovered that the man had died. A granddaughter owned a restaurant near Ilhéus called Tocaia Grande, where she displayed the family weapons as trophies. In Bahia, <em>tocaia</em> has a historically specific sense, referring to a particular kind of isolated rain-forest assassination: a hired gunman, lying in ambush, in a land too big ever to hold him accountable. Amado’s father had been the target of a <em>tocaia;</em> it may have been partly why he fled the <em>fazenda</em> with such dispatch. There would have been no negotiation. You want a neighbor’s land? You kill him. Or you pretend to buy it, visit, bear a gift, and kill him. Or you offer property to a man who has never had it, often an ex-slave, provided he clears and cultivates it, and five years later, never having filed the claim, you kill him: an efficient way of planting trees.</p><p>Katia, Badaró’s mother, growing up on an isolated cacao farm, had been kept ignorant of family history by a protective father, who died when she was sixteen. That year, she made a friend in school, Paloma Amado, the novelist’s daughter, and “the bell jar I had been living in shattered,” she told me. I met her brother, Badaró’s uncle, who had notions about the number of fatalities, but vague ones, because he, like other members of the family, had learned what he knew from Amado’s book. In it, two of Antônio’s sons are shot: Sinhô in a fight, Juca by <em>tocaia</em>. The third son is not a character. This was the uncle’s grandfather and the man he was named after, Domingos: the pacifist, a quiet farmer and peacemaker, who, on New Year’s Day, 1910, ended the violence by marrying a member of the Oliveira family, Anita. According to Badaró’s uncle, she was a “remarkably ugly woman,” but one who “genuinely loved him. She was courted clandestinely—our own Romeo and Juliet—and their marriage ended the cacao wars.”</p><p>Diego Badaró didn’t read Amado’s novel until 2003, the year he decided to devote his life to cacao and needed to understand the burden of his family’s legacy. By then, most members had abandoned the rain forest, in the aftermath of witches’-broom.</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-7 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>Witches’-broom appeared in 1989. It is a fungus that attacks the tree and its fruit, often as it is about to be harvested (overnight, the pod shrivels into a stick and the leaves go brown—hence the name). There was no cure. Cacao is a monoculture crop in Bahia and has always been vulnerable to a sudden disease. The fungus, indigenous to Latin America, could have come from anywhere—a ship’s hold, the flatbed of a pickup truck, the bottom of a boot.</p><p>Once the blight appeared, it spread with baffling efficiency, in all directions. In the second year, ten million trees were infected; half the harvest rotted and was thrown away. By its fifth year, the disease had reached forty-five million trees, eighty per cent of everything ever planted. Five billion dollars had been lost. There were suicides. People wanted out but had no exit. Banks had inventories of foreclosed properties that they couldn’t sell. The warehouses by the pier in Ilhéus were abandoned and now teeter dangerously, the windowpanes gone. The pier is closed, and access to it is roped off for fear of collapse. A hundred and fifty thousand people lost work. In a region so rural, they have no prospects and live on scavenged manioc root. You see the people on the mournful wet road to the sea, the stumps and trees of the original forest cleared a century ago to get the cacao to port, every few miles a plantation, once brazenly Brazilian, a bright turquoise or yellow, now faded to a ghostly pastel, overrun by packs of scrawny animals and occupied by barefoot families boiling water over fires on floors of manor-house bedrooms, the doors kicked out, the windows gone, the walls dissolving from exposure to the constant rain. The owners never appear_._ They can’t get rid of the land, and they can’t make money on it. The farms that haven’t been reclaimed by the forest are run by aging managers who were left behind.</p><div class="cne-interlude-embed"></div><p>Badaró is the exception, and one of the youngest people to return to the forest. He looks after land abandoned by an aunt, by his mother, and his own Monte Alegre. By now, you can get a cacao rootstock that is resistant to the fungus. The forest has almost recovered by itself, although I still saw affected trees everywhere, including on Badaró’s property, the seeds of the pod black, cobwebby, and spoiled-smelling.</p><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">One morning in Salvador, Badaró took me to the market of São Joaquim. The bounty of Brazil—bananas, cocaine, diamonds, rubber, gold, coffee, vanilla, teak, nutmeg, mahogany, sugar, cacao—has always passed through the port city. At the market, you see some of that bounty—the plenitude of an extreme, tropical botany.</p></div><div class="grid--item grid-layout__aside"><div class="sticky-box"><div class="sticky-box__primary"><div class="ad ad--rail"><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--rail"></div></div></div><div class="sticky-box__placeholder"></div></div></div></div><div class="row full-bleed-ad"><div class="ad ad--mid-content"><span class="ad-label">Advertisement</span><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--mid-content"></div></div></div><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><div class="grid--item body body__container article__body grid-layout__content"><p>Badaró introduced me to hundreds of fruits, aisle after aisle of them. I bit into a bulbous <em>caja-umbu</em>, with so much juice it squirted me from head to foot, a long, curving, herbaceously fragrant yellow arc. I delicately ate my way around a <em>caju</em>, red like a tomato, pulpy like a mango, and with a pod on the outside that was fatally poisonous. A yellow berry, a <em>caza</em>, was so sweet and complex that it excited an entrepreneurial fantasy: should I try to export it? There were remedies: A leaf rubbed into a wound was an anti-inflammatory. A seed made into an infusion treated a headache, an unwanted pregnancy, a brain injury. “Ah, <em>catuaba</em>,” Badaró declared, affectionately holding up a piece of wood. “I love this. It is very powerful!” <em>Catuaba</em> was an aphrodisiac.</p><p>I asked about a thick rope, rolled up like a sticky black snake on the ground. It was wild tobacco, a wholly different species from the domesticated Virginia leaf. “The most effective natural insecticide in the world,” Badaró said. “I dust my plants with it.” I bought a three-inch chunk, scrutinized it—wet like motor oil—and popped it into my mouth. I sucked, recognized the flavor of aniseed, and chewed. The chewing released a heat not unlike a chili’s.</p><p>It was a warm afternoon. We made for an exit by way of a butchers’ aisle—in a nose-to-tail art, the cuts, hanging graphically, were principally of the art’s nether regions. A girl with a basket of lemons abruptly stopped in front of me and poked one of the items, displayed on a tray of black-rimmed eyeballs. I’d kept chewing, and an interaction of some kind had occurred between the juices in my mouth and what had been released by the wild tobacco. My tongue had gone numb and the roof and inner cheeks were very hot. Sweat cascaded from my eyebrows, suddenly, as though a valvelike gland had been opened, and my pulse increased. I was also producing an unfamiliar saliva, which filled my mouth. I spit it out. We reached the street. Badaró, in white linen, crossed in front of me, his bright sleeves swelling in the breeze. My mouth filled again.</p><p>Wild tobacco is toxic; in some countries it is banned. The toxin is an alkaloid, a bitter-tasting compound formed by the plant as a defense against being eaten by insects and animals. A plant defends itself in many ways. An alkaloid is the most extreme, principally a response to big threats, and of the twelve thousand alkaloids known to science—quinine, codeine, cocaine, caffeine, ephedrine, strychnine, and nicotine among them—most come from the tropically wooded twenty-twenty zone. Many, like wild tobacco (<em>Nicotiana rustica</em>), originate in Brazil. An implicit dynamic was at work; every fruit, bark, seed, and root had a complexity you didn’t find in a temperate climate. It was defensive.</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-8 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>In the dynamic, I understood cacao, the best-defended fruit in tropical botany. Its sugary seed lands on a rain-forest floor, exposed. It is subjected to the most congested predator traffic (and the highest concentration of microbes, fungi, and possible bacterial attack) on the planet. Cacao contains, unusually, not one alkaloid but several, including caffeine, found in many tropical plants, and theobromine, found in few. It has more than five hundred other chemical compounds, also mainly defensive in purpose. Their benefits were first described by Andrew Waterhouse, in a study, published in <em>The Lancet</em> in 1996_,_ that examined polyphenol content. A polyphenol is an antioxidant. Red wine has plenty: two hundred and ten milligrams. A forty-gram bar of dark chocolate has nine hundred and fifty-one. “There is such a concentration,” Harold McGee, the author of “On Food and Cooking,” told me, “that they create much of chocolate’s uniqueness—the bitterness, the astringency, the edginess, and other sensations that we don’t know about.”</p><p>I discovered some of them during the all-night drive from Salvador. I had eaten one bean after another, hoping to find in it a version of what I believed to be the ultimate flavor of chocolate, when, unexpectedly, I experienced a flat-out, unmitigated euphoric stimulant buzz.</p><p>Badaró nodded, knowingly.</p><p>What had happened? Was it the caffeine? I’d asked.</p><p>No, too little. (A dark-chocolate bar has the equivalent of one cup of coffee.) Theobromine, he said.</p><p>Although theobromine can cause cardiac arrest in dogs, it appears to affect the human nervous system in only modest ways. It creates a few undisputed physiological symptoms. It makes you pee, for instance. Cacao has pharmacological ingredients, including serotonin, the mysterious neurotransmitter of well-being; a cannabinoid component, similar to what is found in marijuana; and a neuromodulator, phenylethylamine, an amphetamine-like antidepressant. But the conventional view is that the quantities are too small to be significant. I felt unsupported by the science. But Badaró understood. So did his uncle Domingos. They ate the beans. Domingos sometimes ate nothing else for days. On the drive, Badaró had also offered me kola nuts, one of the original ingredients in Coca-Cola. “It will also make you alert.” Kola also has theobromine.</p><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">Fermentation has been around forever. It is older than cooking. It was probably the first method of food preparation. Fermentation transforms grapes into wine, grains into beer, wheat into leavened bread. It transforms a raw ingredient, often valued for its nutrition, into one valued for its taste. It yields vinegar, yogurt, sauerkraut, cheese, prosciutto, vanilla, and pickles. It occurs most readily in fruits, because they have, in abundance, the two essential elements: sugar and yeast. A yeast is on a leaf or a branch or in the air. It is the fine white powder on the skin of a grape, like a dust that you should wash off. At its most basic, fermentation is how sugar becomes alcohol.</p><p>In the long history of the rain forest, every hunter-gatherer familiar with the cacao pod would have seen evidence of fermentation. The seeds, in their sugary envelopes, ferment effortlessly. But only Mesoamerican culture understood what to do with them, because it had been using fermentation to prepare foods and alcohols for thousands of years, possibly as early as 7000 B.C., and knew how to control it. Badaró’s process was fundamentally no different.</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-9 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>He conducted it in his “laboratory.” It was a concrete shed. It had doorframes but no doors, an overhead light that had burned out, a temperature alarm that didn’t work, a digital thermometer that was broken, and five large wooden troughs, like pigpens. It was the responsibility of Pedro Jardin, who had been running Monte Alegre for four decades.</p><p>Jardin was now seventy-two, evanescently thin, with high cheekbones and sad eyes. He rarely spoke and seemed never to smile. Jardin had grown up with cacao. By day, he was wrapped, from cap to bright rubber boots, in rain gear. One night, he surprised me. He was barefoot and stripped to the waist, bearing an old Winchester. A Colt revolver was tucked into his trousers. He also had a sawed-off double-barrelled shotgun with a Tommy-gun-style grip. He walked the river before bedtime, a stealthy patrol, tiptoeing in and out of the trees, and returned to lock everyone in for the night—a claustrophobic touch, I felt, until I was wakened by something hurling itself against my door. Each time the door was struck, it lifted off its hinges slightly—four or five times, a ferocious force—until whatever it was (animal? man?) went away.</p></div><div class="grid--item grid-layout__aside"><div class="sticky-box"><div class="sticky-box__primary"><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="" class="recirc-most-popular-wrapper viewport-monitor-anchor"></div></div><div class="sticky-box__placeholder"></div></div></div></div><div class="row full-bleed-ad"><div class="ad ad--mid-content"><span class="ad-label">Advertisement</span><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--mid-content"></div></div></div><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><div class="grid--item body body__container article__body grid-layout__content"><p>Jardin was waiting for us at the lab. It was late in the afternoon, a still, equatorial twilight about to turn dark, in the sudden way of the tropics. You could smell what was going on from fifty feet. It was a brewery.</p><p>Inside, the room was shadowy and hot. The smells multiplied instantly, a sudden olfactory cargo: a brewery, but also a winery, a vinegar factory, a dairy. It could have been an exaggerated version of an English pub. There was a gas, mildly disconcerting. It singed the lungs but felt strangely pleasant.</p><p>Schilling inhaled. “Aaah, get those acetic acids up your nose.”</p><p>One trough was full. The beans, about chest-high, were covered with banana leaves, a gently heaving green blanket, wrapped tight, an oven on high. The yeast plus sugar produced carbon dioxide, plus heat and alcohol. There were plenty of yeasts on the banana leaves, a rich source, an additional insurance that could kick-start a fermentation if it hadn’t already begun, or else add to it. There were yeasts in the slats of the trough, the natural ones in the wood as well as those left over from previous fermentations. The beans had yeasts. The humid tropical air had them. The forest had them. I thought about the yeast in bread. This approach seemed less about control than about attack.</p><p>Badaró pulled back some leaves. The beans instantly released a more intense hit of everything we’d been smelling. It was alcoholic and vaporous.</p><p>They were in their third day of fermentation, and were now purply, the sweet pulp almost entirely gone, although still gooey. “A ton,” Badaró said.</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-10 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>“A ton?” Schilling and I both asked, and looked again, feeling compelled to do the banal calculation. “Two thousand pounds?” The beans were so compact.</p><p>The full trough was separated from other empty ones by wooden slats. Badaró removed one so that he could shovel beans into the next space. No matter how tightly everything was wrapped, the beans on top were cooler than the ones at the bottom. By shovelling everything next door, Badaró was turning them over. Normally, Jardin would then hop inside, shuffling beans under his boots, poking a toe into corners, to insure that every bean was equally fermented. Other foods are not fermented in this way. In wine, yeast converts the sugars in grapes into alcohol. No one worries if some haven’t fermented. At the end, they, and the mashed skins and stems that remain, a shapeless purple sponge, are thrown out. With cacao, an infantry of yeasts converge on the pulp around a seed and convert it into alcohol—plus acids and carbon dioxide and heat, none of it important, because none of it is the point. The liquids drain away; the alcohol evaporates. The attack doesn’t stop. The seed is heated to a temperature rarely seen in the natural world. The shell is savaged and penetrated, until the tissue inside is invaded. At the end, the bean is the equivalent of the grapey mash. It has been reduced in size. It smells powerfully of vinegar. Its proteins have been disfigured. If you open one up, its insides look as though they’d been obliterated. In the devastation, the extreme intensities of cacao are converted to flavors.</p><p>Badaró, meanwhile, was trying to fix his thermostat. He wanted to keep the temperature from exceeding a hundred and twenty-two degrees Fahrenheit, but he had no way of measuring it. The beans in the trough seemed hotter than that. I stared at them, trying to gauge how hot they might be, and then I did a thing that seemed strange at the time but was really just a misunderstanding. I took off my shirt, shoes, and pants, and, with my boxers on, I swung myself over the side and sank into the beans. They really were very hot.</p><p>I had wanted to get a sense of what you went through to complete cacao’s strange fermentation, and had assumed that most people wouldn’t be wearing many clothes. Jardin stared at me with a look of apparent horror.</p><p>Then Schilling removed his clothes, slipped into the beans, and was jubilant. “Yoni juice,” he said. “Yoni of cacao juice.” He filled his hands with beans, looked up, and poured them down on his face.</p><p>Badaró then removed his clothes. He landed with an awkward splash. Three of us were in a trough that might comfortably accommodate an adult pig, and the fermenting cacao was up to our necks. Badaró had taken to invoking some god, humming in his deep voice. “We must immerse ourselves and connect to the Aztec gods,” he said. He disappeared, sinking below the surface. When he reëmerged, he was covered in goop: beans behind his ears, stuck to his eyelids, clinging to his hair.</p><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">When Schilling and Holderman returned to Boulder from their first Fancy Food Show, in the summer of 2001, he knew they had a winner. According to Holderman, he also had a plan: five years to build the company, then sell it. “We’ll be rich!”</p><p>“In those days, it was still a ‘we’ thing,” Holderman told me. Dagoba was owned by Schilling, his parents, his uncle, and Holderman. (She is unsure how many shares she had.) “That was ‘our’ goal— ‘rich’ in five years. He doesn’t remember saying this. But I do.” (And he doesn’t: “I am very confident I didn’t state this. I’ll take a lie-detector test.”)</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-11 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>They had a division of labor: he made; she sold. Her calls were done cold. “ ‘Want to try a new chocolate?’ No one said no. I was peddling a legalized drug.” Schilling filled the orders, pouring each one with a measuring cup, eight hours a day, the easy rhythm of a repetitive task, fuelled by vast quantities of marijuana.</p><p>One morning, he got a call from an East Coast distributor, his first, who wanted ten thousand bars. “I was excited,” Schilling said, “and then thought, Oh, shit, I have to pour each one.” For ten eighteen-hour days, he did nothing else. His mother, who lived in Minnesota, flew in to help. She arrived on a Friday, wrapped bars until three in the morning, dizzy from the glue stick used to seal them, and returned to the airport on Sunday night. After the first distributor, others followed. (“They could now trust the neophyte manufacturer with his odd chocolates.”) The orders meant success, but also chaos. Schilling forgot to order wrappers. The air-conditioning broke. Chocolate was compromised. The basement flooded. The accounts were bad lecture notes. “We were winging it. We needed Papa Jon.”</p><p>Schilling’s father was, in Holderman’s description, single-dimensional and myopic: “We were just going for each other.” He was a threat. To the father, she was just the girlfriend. He never disliked her (“She was, above all, an absolutely gorgeous, stunning, vivacious young lady”); he just didn’t rate her. He never imagined her as a partner in the future business, even though she was a co-founder and a shareholder. The son was the project, “a visionary,” but with no register of risk, no future tense. “He couldn’t even spell the word ‘business.’ ” They had issues. The father didn’t “get” organics. “They argued constantly,” Holderman said. “Every day, over morning coffee, at lunch, it was nothing but the business. I wasn’t interested in business.”</p></div><div class="grid--item grid-layout__aside"><div class="sticky-box"><div class="sticky-box__primary"><div class="ad ad--rail"><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--rail"></div></div></div><div class="sticky-box__placeholder"></div></div></div></div><div class="row full-bleed-ad"><div class="ad ad--mid-content"><span class="ad-label">Advertisement</span><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--mid-content"></div></div></div><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><div class="grid--item body body__container article__body grid-layout__content"><p>There were fights, hysterics. “The females in my life, both personal and professional, have been very emotional,” the father observed. “I don’t think I will ever understand their psyche.”</p><p>Holderman began, in her words, “acting out in a mild way and then not such a mild way.” She told Schilling: Marry me and take me away.</p><p>He gave her a ring and they moved to Ashland, a town of twenty thousand people, in southern Oregon. They found a space with a large walk-in refrigerator and tables for packing. It was thrilling, according to Holderman, a “bona-fide chocolate factory.” But the father followed. Then the mother moved there from Minnesota; the sister from California. “At least, I was still his business partner,” Holderman said. If she hadn’t been, she recognizes, she would never have seen Schilling, because, astonishingly, he was still pouring bars by hand. In the summer of 2002, the company made its first million dollars in sales, but Schilling was in the back with his measuring cup, “smoking a big stick during the lunch hour,” convinced that anyone buying his chocolate would know he had personally made it. He couldn’t keep up. By Dagoba’s second anniversary, he finally bought a small depositor, a machine that fills molds. Sales tripled by the end of the year, reaching three and a half million dollars. They then bought a huge machine, costing two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, paid for by selling five per cent of the company to his mother’s six siblings (putting its worth at probably around seven million dollars). But in Holderman’s view nothing was changing. Her mother came one weekend and was put to work. “We wrapped bars until we could no longer stand, went home, passed out, got up, did it again. My mother wasn’t unhappy to help. I was unhappy she had to.”</p><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">In fact, there had been a change. Schilling had had a “visitation.” A woman had appeared to him in a waking dream.</p><p>The predawn visitor was Xochiquetzal, a goddess of cacao. Schilling recognized her. He had been studying Mesoamerican religions, and believed cacao to be a sacred food. The reverence had been evident in the naming of his company, originally Gadoba, a temple, because eating a chocolate should be like a moment of prayer, “each bite a personal gadoba.” He then wondered if Gadoba sounded too much like Godiva, the Belgian chocolatier. So he switched the “g” and the “d.” “He just liked the sound,” Holderman told me. He discovered later that a dagoba was a Buddhist shrine, and that worked, too.</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-12 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>The goddess asked Schilling to accompany her, and they flew over North America, across the Atlantic, and into West Africa, a first stop. As a child, Schilling hadn’t liked chocolate because, like most of us, he had grown up eating what was made in West Africa, and he didn’t like the flavor. Eighty per cent of the world’s cacao comes from there, principally the Ivory Coast, where trees were planted in 1905, the year that chocolate became industrial and global.</p><p>West African cacao is cultivated by the “pioneer” method and has few of the vagaries of a rain forest. The plantations are tightly managed and mechanically irrigated, with close plantings and little shade, and exposed to an intense direct light that makes the trees hyperproductive. Schilling and Xochiquetzal watched what would happen next. (“You were hovering above on what—a carpet?” I asked. “No, just floating.”) The trees quickly become exhausted, the farm is closed, a swath of forest burns, and the business starts over. Land is cheap, labor is cheap, the beans are cheap. There are problems: “black pod rot” (with the trees so crowded); a dependence on pesticides; accusations of child labor and slavery.</p><p>Xochiquetzal and Schilling flew east into Sri Lanka. Then Bali, Java, Malaysia, the Philippines—all developed to meet modern needs. They flew across the Pacific and reached South America, and found patches of parched earth, once a rain forest, the origins of cacao, now blighted and infertile, “dead-brown, like a scab.” They inspected the Amazon Basin, on fire and with trees in flames. They flew up through Central America and paid a solemn visit to a Mayan tomb. Schilling was then returned to his bed. Xochiquetzal had a mission for him. He understood and swore an oath of allegiance.</p><p>He was shaking. The visitation had lasted forty-one minutes. It was five twenty-three. He woke Holderman and described what he had seen. “I didn’t tell her I was now pledged to a goddess—I didn’t want to hurt her.”</p><p>Holderman sleeps deeply. “A dream?” she said, when I asked her about it. “Really? No, that one eludes me. A dream, you say?”</p><p>The couple broke up. “We had to,” Schilling said. “I couldn’t be unfaithful.” Holderman returned to Boulder, married one of Schilling’s good friends, and is now a massage therapist. Schilling hasn’t had a serious girlfriend since (“I can’t—I’m married to cacao”), now lives by the Mayan calendar, and began a life of manic tropical travel: in the past year, Costa Rica (twice), Panama, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Mexico, Ecuador, Peru, the Dominican Republic (three times), and Brazil (three times).</p><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">Last year, on October 19th, Schilling may have had another visitation. He remembers nothing, but he woke in a condition of heightened clarity. By then, he had fifty employees in Oregon. He was helping to sustain a coöperative farm in the Dominican Republic, a family in Peru, an enterprise in Guatemala. He made bars sold in Whole Foods, hippie pharmacies, organic markets, and beside the cash registers of independent bookstores.</p><p>He had an immodest vision that he couldn’t stop thinking about. It involved all the stripped, torched, desiccated, denuded, barren land of the ruined tropics. Why couldn’t he figure out how to buy it up, most of it worthless anyway, and replant it with cacao, and, in effect, reforest the planet with chocolate bars?</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-13 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>I had been advised about Schilling’s ambitions. “He has no limits,” Holderman had told me forcefully. She described a trip the two of them once took to visit her family in Pennsylvania, passing through the town of Hershey. She was silenced by the scale, memories of a childhood visit, the wonder of it all, and, turning to Schilling, was alarmed by his focus and what he appeared to be thinking: he seemed to be measuring his future against Hershey’s achievements. Schilling wanted to be a player, and not just a normal high-stakes player but an ideological one: someone who could change the world.</p><p>On the morning of his clarity, Schilling called his father. For months, Papa Jon had been working out the details of a sale (“Frankly, I just wanted to get a good chunk of change”), even though it had never been approved by his son. “Let’s do it,” Schilling said, and by nightfall a deal was done—so quickly it seemed like a spontaneous act—and Hershey became Dagoba’s owner. The price was seventeen million dollars. Schilling was retained as a consultant.</p><p>That night, Schilling met friends, broke down, and wept uncontrollably for twelve hours. He spent the next month defending himself from charges made by organic colleagues that he was a “sellout.” “How could I make a difference at Dagoba, working on such a small scale?” he said repeatedly, an incomprehensible argument to people who had no idea that he wanted to plant two or three billion trees and that he had the support of a goddess. Holderman, who got the news by group e-mail, was one of the few friends who were not surprised. “It was right on time, wasn’t it?” she said. Five years, give or take a month or two, since the first Fancy Food Show. ♦</p></div><div class="grid--item grid-layout__aside"><div class="sticky-box"><div class="sticky-box__primary"><div class="ad ad--rail"><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--rail"></div></div></div><div class="sticky-box__placeholder"></div></div></div></div></div><div role="none"><div role="none"><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><div class="grid--item body body__truncation-message article__body grid-layout__content"><div class="container container--body"><div class="container--body-inner"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article><div class="content-footer"><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><footer class="grid--item content-footer__magazine-disclaimer grid-layout__content">Published in the print edition of the<!-- --> <a href="/magazine/2007/10/29">October 29, 2007</a>, issue<!-- -->.</footer></div><div class="row"><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><div class="contributors contributors--no-bottom-line grid--item grid-layout__content"><div class="contributor-bio contributor-bio--align-left contributors__contributor-bio"><div class="contributor-bio__content"><div class="contributor-bio__bio"><a href="/contributors/bill-buford">Bill Buford</a>’s next book is “Dirt (Five Years in the Ancient Kitchens of Lyon, Where My Children Became Frenchies and I Trained to be a Chef),” which will be published in September.

organic-chocolate company. Schilling had just turned thirty, Holderman was twenty-nine, and the show was the first entrepreneurial event of their lives. Dagoba had no employees and no orders. It had a lease for a ground-floor industrial space in Boulder, Colorado (the “factory”), and an investment of twenty thousand dollars (borrowed from Schilling’s mother and an uncle), which, after flights, a hotel, and a fee for the smallest possible booth, against a dark wall in the basement of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, was gone. It also had “launch products”—seven bars, including infusions of raspberry and mint—an amateurish jamboree, confected and poured into molds by a man who had never liked chocolate, hand-wrapped by a woman who rarely ate more than two ounces a year, and tested only by their Boulder friends and roommates, a scraggly crew of ski bums and folksingers. Dagoba was more bedroom than boardroom. In New York, that changed."],["cm-unit"],["p","“I was overwhelmed,” Holderman told me. “The magnitude of the show, the number of other chocolate companies—I had no idea.” Their venture had begun a few months earlier, on Valentine’s Day. Holderman and Schilling were on a chairlift, skiing in the Arapahoe Basin, when Schilling said he could wait no longer (“I need to do this now!”). He raced down, shopped, got home, melted two batches of organic chocolate, infusing one with milk chai, the other with raspberries and rose hips, poured them into heart-shaped molds, and served them on a silver platter to the hundred friends who came over for a party that went on till the next morning, with guests naked in a hot tub, “praying for peace,” as a red sun brightened the Continental Divide."],["p","The Fancy Food Show runs for three days. By the end, Holderman and Schilling’s samples had disappeared in a bewildering thirty-six-hour gobblefest, their picture taken so often that they felt like celebrities—the boyfriend-girlfriend team with wacky organics—and Schilling, a self-described alchemist, entered the happiest period of his life. He became a chocolate-maker."],["native-ad",{"position":"in-content","shouldDisplayLabel":false}],["p","I found Schilling at this year’s show slumped uncomfortably in a plastic chair. His face was in a cup of coffee, absorbing steam. He was wearing an oversized floppy cotton shirt, the top buttons undone, a hairy chest on display, jeans, clogs, a discolored shiny leather bracelet. He was wolverine thin, with an unshaven scratchy face, sagging cheeks, and soft round sacks under his eyes, and his breath smelled so powerfully of red wine from the night before that a staff member gave him two sticks of cinnamon gum. He had just returned from a trip to Bali, Java, and Sulawesi, including a stint in the tropical backcountry, and he kept running a hand through his hair, as if to make sure that a soft-tissue creature hadn’t made a home there. He wasn’t on a New York clock yet, he explained, but realized, counting slowly, that he’d been here five days. He looked up, perplexed, his eyes so red they could have been rubbed with sand."],["p","Schilling is thirty-six, no longer a novice but still not the obvious founder of a manufacturing company with many millions of dollars in sales. His education has been scattershot. He applied to one college, St. John’s in New Mexico, didn’t get in, prepared to enter a monastery, and, at the last minute, was offered a scholarship by Ohio Wesleyan to play lacrosse. (“I love lacrosse!”) He intended to study religion, hoping to satisfy a spiritual need, but, in the summer, attended a music festival “in the sacred valley of Telluride” and never returned. He worked for a record store, the sum of his business experience. He played guitar. He wrote songs, smoked “an insane amount of herbal blends,” and was the lead singer in a band. After six years, he moved to Boulder, but, fundamentally, his life never changed."],["p","At the show, Schilling and I walked past the French chocolates of Michel Cluizel and saw a photograph of the white-haired patriarch surrounded by his offspring: four scrawny young adults, each assigned to a different division of the business. Dagoba is an inverted version. Schilling has no children, but his mother, a soft-spoken sixty-one-year-old divorcée, looks after the front office. She was running the stand that morning. An older sister, unmarried, keeps the books. And his father, a misanthropic ex-I.B.M. corporate manager, retired at forty-nine (“So I could golf, drink beer, bowl, and play blackjack at Indian casinos,” he told me), was summoned one weekend to give lessons in how to run a business and stayed for years. “How do I travel so much?” Schilling said. “I’ve got Papa Jon nearby, Sister Becky doing the accounts, and Mother Mary working the phones.” He beamed. His smile was disarming because it was so trusting, confident that the affection it conveyed would be reciprocated, and his manner, despite the hangover and the slouch and the exhaustion, was irrepressibly cheerful. “",["em","Theobroma cacao"],",” he exhaled—the scientific name given to chocolate by Linnaeus—stretching out his arms as though to embrace his products in a loving hug. “",["em","Theos"],", god.

In 2006, its sales increased by fifteen per cent. Dark chocolate represents a quarter of what Americans buy, four billion dollars last year, and industry analysts, who believe that sales will reach nearly five and a half billion by 2011, don’t see an end. One says that it “will drive the chocolate sector for the next hundred years.” An appreciation of dark chocolate is now a sign of a discriminating palate. Most chocolate has no such pretensions. It ends up in a candy bar or a chocolate Easter egg or an M&M-like treat referred to by the trade as “bagged product.” But taste is a powerful force—in effect, “taste” is “culture”—which I hadn’t fully understood until Schilling introduced me to his high-end hands-on fellow-manufacturers."],["p","They were uniformly earnest. They told no jokes. They seemed to have no interest in selling, wanting to talk only about what they made, bars invariably (anything else—a filled confection like a truffle, for instance—was frivolous), in the compulsive, insistent way that upmarket vintners go on about their wines. The intellectual index was the wrapper, the compact culinary encyclopedia of what was inside. It might tell you where the beans came from. (Madagascar is this year’s hot real estate.) It might reveal the varietal. One of the rarest is a Porcelana, from South America; Amedei, an Italian company, sells it for a hundred and twenty-seven dollars a pound. There were “crus,” named after specific farms. Some bars had a harvest year. I got one from an Internet supplier, a 2002, made from Chuao Valley beans in Venezuela, three years past its sell-by date. Suspecting a gimmick, I ate it to confirm its staleness. I was surprised. It seemed fresher than other bars I’d bought. If kept dry, a chocolate with a high cacao content, I’ve discovered, rarely spoils."],["ad",{"position":"mid-content"}],["p","The cacao content is a wrapper’s most important datum, and the acceptable benchmark is seventy per cent. The figure is a measure of “cocoa mass.” (The English language uses “cacao,” the Mayan word for the tree, and “cocoa,” an eighteenth-century corruption, interchangeably.) The mass is what you get after you grind up the beans, a gooey wet gob. I did this at home. I put old, dry beans in a coffee grinder, and was surprised by the amount of liquid they produced. It is fat, a lot of it, half the bean’s content, although the fat is mainly unsaturated, the kind that’s good for you, like an avocado’s. This benchmark figure is now the heart of contemporary dark-chocolate culture. It provides a confederation of obsessives with a name, “the seventy-per-cent club” (pure chocolate, “no bonbons”)—the snobbiest of the snobby, according to Schilling. It is the number on most of the chocolates I saw. Amedei’s Porcelana is seventy per cent. So is an Ocumare Grand Cru, an award-winning new product, named after a Venezuelan valley unknown to anyone except other fanatics."],["p","I tasted it with Schilling. His face gave little away. “Good chocolate,” he said finally."],["p","I had a bite and thought: Harmonic, pure."],["p","“Expensive beans,” he added, quietly. “But good.” He had another bite. “In fact,” he declared, “this is very good.” It was too emphatic. I wondered if he had a reservation he wasn’t expressing, maybe out of respect to the maker, Art Pollard. In 1996, Pollard had a midlife cacao epiphany and has been on a quest for perfect chocolate ever since. This was one of his three products. It might be years before he produced another. I studied him: pale skin, soft middle, a wife he never sees, talking, talking, talking. His life was this bar."],["p","Schilling took me to the Valrhona stand, the French maker, and we tasted a Guanaja, named after a Caribbean island where chocolate was first seen by a European. Columbus, on his last voyage, in 1502, came upon a dugout canoe filled with brown beans, clearly regarded by their Mayan crew as precious: everyone panicked when some spilled. But Columbus, eager to get on, dismissed them as strange almonds. Valrhona’s Guanaja was the world’s first seventy-per-cent bar, the chocolate world’s equivalent of an airplane’s breaking the sound barrier. It was released in 1986, after two years of secret testing by pastry chefs and tastings and retastings by a Valrhona jury. Before the Guanaja, most dark chocolate was half sugar, a so-called bittersweet confection."],["p","Since then, Valrhona has followed the same studied approach in launching any new bar. It was founded in 1924 and has ten basic bars. El Rey, founded in 1929, has nine bars. Scharffen Berger has six.

He has his dark bars, like everyone else—a New Moon (seventy-four per cent), a darker moon (the Eclipse, eighty-seven per cent), and the hundred-per-cent Prima Materia, the refined version of what I produced with my coffee grinder, a brick of intensely complex flavors that can be eaten only in small quantities over a long period. But mainly he has whatever occurs to him. “This seventy-per-cent thing is a health craze, not a flavor craze. I’ve had seventy-per-cent bars that I wouldn’t put in my compost pile. Does anyone have any idea what these percentages mean?"],["p","“I want surprises in my chocolate,” he explained. “I don’t want purity. I like peaks and valleys. Good beans, bad ones, the perfect and the flawed. Today, everyone wants the established names, the Ocumares, the Madagascars. I like getting in the truck and driving sixteen hours to a village that hasn’t replaced its original stock with the latest hybrid. Every bean is a story.”"],["p","Schilling doesn’t have the patience to conduct tastings over two years. “I prepare a flavor in my mind. Once it’s there, I can make the actual physical object quickly.” An idea occurs to him, invariably at night (“Bottles of red wine essential”), he realizes it in the morning (knife, toaster oven, spice grinder), and manufactures it in a week. He knows one appetite, one curiosity, and one palate: his own."],["p","“What do I want from a chocolate?” he asked. “A beginning and an end. I start with the breast of a woman on her back.” He illustrated with his hand how a breast flattens when a woman lies down. “That’s my flavor curve. You start with the belly.” He used his forefinger like a pencil. “You then move up her body, climbing slowly, rising up the flattened curve of the breast, gently, and the nipple pops out suddenly. Have you noticed how a woman’s nipple pops out when she is on her back? Then you slide down, an elegant finish.” He looked at me. “It always comes back to sex.”"],["p","He also makes tinctures: “Clarity” for mornings, “Moon Cycle” for a woman’s period, and “Eros,” a constellation of every tribal moonbeam fringe aphrodisiac he could find. It was foul; it tasted like a drug store. I asked Schilling if he used it. “Oh, yes.” He cited an ingredient, damiana, that he once mixed into a chocolate served at a party. He won’t do that again. “People were having sex on a couch.”"],["p","I stared at the bottle. You took it in a dropper."],["p","“We don’t sell a lot of these here in New York,” Schilling said. “It’s probably a West Coast thing.”"],["p","He has three drinking chocolates—he brushes his teeth with the unsweetened one—and recently experimented with another, made from raw seeds.

Why make a drink that tastes disgusting?"],["p","“Antioxidants,” he said. “The benefits are frickin’ off the charts. But most never even make it into the product.” He offered an example: “Dutching,” a process developed in 1828 by Coenraad van Houten, a Dutch chemist. The fats in chocolate are notoriously temperamental and don’t like water, and the drink had always been grainy. Van Houten figured out how to squeeze out most of the fats with a heavy press, and then pulverize the cakey leftovers into a powder: better, but still silty. He then added an alkaline, sodium carbonate, and rendered the smooth modern cocoa. But alkaline destroys antioxidants."],["p","“You will never understand cacao until you see it in the tropics,” Schilling said one day. He mentioned Diego Badaró, a “spiritual brother” who farms it in the rain forests of Brazil. We should go to Bahia, Schilling proposed. And I agreed."],["p",{"class":"has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading"},"A few weeks later, Badaró at the wheel of a Land Rover, Schilling and I entered cacao country at five in the morning, an hour before a tropical dawn revealed green, foggy wet hills, the landscape of the Mata Atlântica, the rain forest of the Brazilian coast. A banner of welcome was stretched above the road, Highway 101. We’d been driving south for six hours, having set out from Salvador, Bahia’s capital. We ate cacao beans to stay awake. We stopped at a twenty-four-hour tapioca stand. We passed a muddy market square, with posts to tie your horse. A monkey ran across the road."],["ad",{"position":"mid-content"}],["p","“",["em","Jupara"],",” Badaró said."],["p",["em","Jupara"]," was the mythic animal that introduced cacao to the rain forests here. It is said to have entered Bahia bearing a pod, which it broke open, eating the pulp, discarding the seeds, and sowing the first tree, having run from the Amazon Basin, two thousand miles away. Most botanists believe the fruit originated in the Amazon, and they continue to find new varieties there—more than anyone can count, each an expression of a unique micro-rain-forest spot. Bahia is the Amazon’s geographical next-of-kin: the same climate, forest canopy, diverse floor. But there is no wild cacao; the tree was introduced, most likely by a Frenchman, Louis Frederick Warneaux, who, in 1746, sowed seeds near one of Bahia’s large rivers."],["p","By then, the fruit, which grows in the shade in warm, wet latitudes—the “twenty-twenty zone”—had migrated from the Amazon Basin, adapting and cross-pollinating along the way, west and north through Venezuela, Panama, southern Mexico, where it was cultivated by a succession of Mesoamerican civilizations. The Olmecs, on the Gulf Coast, were the first, around 1300 B.C. They called it ",["em","kakawa"],". You still find semi-wild trees in Mexico’s humid lowlands, and some of the world’s fruitier blond-brown chocolate comes from family holdings there. Mayans were next. By 1519, when Hernán Cortés and his army attended an Aztec feast on the island capital of Tenochtitlán (now Mexico City) and witnessed the seed in a beverage, cacao was a profoundly sophisticated food."],["p","The Spaniards had seen nothing like it. The “beans,” as dried seeds were called, were roasted over a fire; crushed into a paste; flavored with flowers, chilies, black pepper, and vanilla; diluted with cold water; poured between vessels until a froth formed; and served in a lacquered gourd, by a train of solemnly reverent women, to Motecuhzoma Xocoyotzin. Montezuma drank it all night—fifty cups, by one account—and ",["em","cacahuatl"],", when later presented in Europe as ",["em","chocolatl"],", would have two specific associations arising out of the high theatre of its introduction: as an élitist food (only the ruler drank it) and an erotic one (the suggestive female attendants). It had more rarefied associations among the Aztecs. For them, it was a divine food: the gift of a deity, Quetzalcóatl, and used in the worship of Xochiquetzal, a fertility goddess. It was consumed at births, sacrifices, and funerals. It was a trading currency—three beans bought you a fresh avocado, one an overripe one—and hoarded in storehouses. (Nine hundred and sixty million beans were counted in one stash, according to Sophie and Michael Coe in their “True History of Chocolate,” the best account of cacao in Mesoamerica.) The Aztecs couldn’t grow it—they had the wrong climate—and, like others, depended on colonies of rain-forest farmers."],["p","Among them were the Kekchi Mayans, in Guatemala. In 1544, a group was invited to Spain by Dominican priests and, in an audience with Prince Philip, the future king, made Europe’s first recorded chocolate drink. Commercial shipments began in 1585, arriving in Seville, and by the early sixteen-hundreds the beverage—the Aztec preparation, served warm, with European flavorings (sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg)—had its own high-society rituals, including ornate serving vessels and a ",["em","molinillo"],", a stirrer to make the froth. The beans were probably from Guatemala, the blond-brown variety prized today. Spaniards call it ",["em","criollo"],", the “native.”"],["p","In London, the first chocolate shop opened, on Gracechurch Street, in 1657. Two private clubs, White’s and the Garrick, got their start as chocolate houses. By 1664, when Pepys was writing about the new beverage (“To Mr. Blands and there drank my morning draught in good Chocolatte, and slabbering my band sent home for another”), he was a representative European consumer. He didn’t understand what he was drinking, had no idea how it was made, and knew only that it came from the New World and that he wanted as much as he could get. In the face of a global shortage, an equatorial panic set in, and prospectors and opportunists fanned out across the tropics, looking for wild trees and planting new ones. Spaniards started finding a darker, more bitter variety in South America, an immigrant cousin of the Amazon Basin’s original bean, which they called ",["em","forastero"],", the “newcomer.” By the end of the seventeenth century, the Spanish had found trees in Venezuela and Ecuador. They planted some in Trinidad, the French planted in Martinique, the English in Jamaica. Jesuits finally discovered the original ",["em","forastero"]," along the Amazon, the wild breed that had started everything, an astonishing bounty. But it was deep in the backcountry, and their harvest often rotted before reaching a port."],["p",{"class":"has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading"},"The Rio de Contas, a wide, almost deltalike river, was startling, a sudden big sky and a feeling of openness, and very bright. It was noisy with birds. The rain forest houses most of the earth’s plant and animal population. I hadn’t anticipated it would be so loud. The effect was unexpectedly welcoming: you felt isolated but not alone. Badaró’s property was called Monte Alegre, and was some miles away. The road was flooded, not really a road but a shallow bog, with giant holes that seemed deep enough to sink the vehicle. The air smelled of burning wet wood. We passed a house, once white, now moldy black and fighting off the forest, its front door long gone, five small children in front, a cloying, damp smoke coming out of a chimney. We passed another, with a sliding roof, the drying area for cacao beans, built to close up when it rained. There were monkeys, hawks, and toucans. There were pigs, chickens, and a mule. An old man was out for a hunt, followed by his wife. He looked cantankerous and unhopeful, carrying a musket and a bag of homemade ammunition."],["p","The road climbed a hill.

He was wearing high black boots and forest-green rain gear. He was tall, with some bulk, and had thick eyebrows and jet-black hair, parted in the middle. A machete was strapped to his belt. He was twenty-six but had the deliberate, unexcitable manner of an older man, and a deep baritone, referred to by his family as “the voice.” He used it to speak to officials. In his bearing, he could have been sixty, with a dozen children. Instead, he had a thirty-four-year-old stepson. His wife, Luiza, a dark-haired artist, was fifty-five, the same age as his mother."],["p","He had eccentricities. On the journey down, he had turned off the headlights—despite curves, blind hilltops, other vehicles—in order to see the stars better. He drove at bewildering speed. He lost control once, the Land Rover snapping back and forth in a succession of extreme hydroplaning skids. He often prayed: to Ewa, a god of serpents; to Oxossi, the hunter god (Badaró’s personal deity); and to a dozen others, West African in origin. One night, I accompanied him to a worship service in Salvador—an airless room, chanting, drums, members working themselves into a trance, throwing themselves about, jabbering—and met his mother, Katia. A warrior woman—helmet, dagger, breastplate—grabbed Badaró, made battle cries, and grunted."],["ad",{"position":"mid-content"}],["p","At the ",["em","fazenda"],", Schilling spotted the first cacao.

He saw more, full-sized footballs, bright yellow, mainly, but also red and orange-yellow, looking even more preposterously pendulant."],["p","Badaró twisted a pod off a trunk and lopped off the top with his machete. The inside was creamy wet. It smelled of honey and orange and perfume. This was the pulp surrounding the giant seeds. The seeds looked like wet white maggots. Nothing suggested chocolate. Badaró stuck his fingers inside, pulled out some seeds, and tipped them into my hand, and I ate them. They had a slimy, sweet zing, more liquid than substance, and as I rubbed them against the roof of my mouth the pulp disintegrated. I was left with four seeds—still a mouthful. I bit one gently. It was bitter, awful. I spit it out."],["p","The spitting is everything. Cacao has peculiar rain-forest dependency. If the pod is not removed, it shrivels and the seeds die. It needs to tempt whatever happens by—monkey, man, squirrel, rat—to stop, wrestle it off its stubby stalk, break it, drink the nectar, eat the pulp (or try to), and cough out the seeds. No creature likes the seeds; the fruit’s future is in its immediate ejection. The seeds that end up on the rain-forest floor sprout within hours of exposure to the air."],["p","Badaró lopped off another pod. I raised it over my head like a canteen, hoping to get a taste of ",["em","miel de cacao"],", the honey. It is what remains after the seeds have been drained, but it keeps for no more than a day. You never see it outside the twenty-twenty zone. In Bahia, it is a specialty, drunk in the shade of the trees that made it."],["p","We climbed back into the vehicle and followed a two-track road into the trees, where we found four men sitting on the ground, surrounded by yellow fruits, thwacking them rhythmically with their machetes, digging out the pulp, and tossing the empty pods to the side. The pulp was heaped into a white, gooey mound, and a viscous liquid trickled down into a receptacle. Badaró poured some of it into a discarded pod."],["p","It had the same bright citrus flavor that made the pulp so startling. How could there be citrus notes? I identified acidity and sugar; I thought of grapefruit, qualities associated with a sun-ripened fruit: a translucent skin, exposure to direct light. But a cacao pod has a white, inch-thick shell, like a chunk of Styrofoam."],["p","Badaró poured more into my gourd. It seemed to balance sweetness and acidity, weight and liquidity, mouthfeel and perfume; if not universal in its appeal, it was clearly irresistible to all but a few palates. In effect, the tree had made a monkey out of me so I could help it along by spitting out the seeds."],["p",{"class":"has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading"},"In Bahia, the cacao business started slowly because the rewards came so slowly: you stuck a sapling into a wild, uninhabited land and waited. It might be ten years before you saw money from the fruit. Offspring of the Frenchman’s first tree may have been growing since the eighteenth century, but no cacao was harvested until the demand from Europe was great enough to make the labor worthwhile. By the middle of the nineteenth century, the Dutch had reinvented chocolate as a beverage, and the cacao butter extracted in the process had been used by the Cadbury brothers, in England, to make their first bar."],["p","By 1850, chocolate was being made in factories, on a much larger scale. By then, farmers in Bahia had developed the ",["em","cabruca"]," system, a way of cultivating a wild tree in a wild forest by thinning out the understory—trunks, dwarf palms, vines—planting in the cleared space, and preserving the canopy for protection: the rain forest disturbed but basically intact. (The earth is almost sterile; nutrition comes from the trees.) By then, the Bahians also recognized that their harvest had a better chance of reaching port than anything hauled out of the Amazon. The forest wasn’t less impenetrable; it just grew right up to the sea, and deep rivers led out of it."],["p","But it wasn’t easy, even by 1920, as Roy Nash, an ex-army adventurer, observed in the three years he spent in the region. On a visit to a cacao plantation on the Rio de Contas, Nash came across an Olympian effort: a gang of workers driving mule-led pack trains, trying to get their harvest to a rail depot and then to port, “troop after troop struggling with their precious cargoes through mud that ate the very heart out of the beasts and through water that ate much cash value out of the beans. Two days to the railroad, two days back, two weeks for the animals to recuperate!” Nash’s account, “The Conquest of Brazil” (1926), is a rare contemporary document of what was becoming an unusually secretive land visited by few foreigners, mainly because, as Nash saw firsthand—in flight from a cacao gang of two hundred “with Winchesters across their saddles”—this giant territory was simply not governed. He witnessed a shooting at a dance, a stabbing on a train, a private army stopping an election, another in a battle with the governor’s troops, a gangster’s “game of raid, rape, and run,” hired gunmen, and “colonels” everywhere—landowners entitled to make their own laws and enforce them with armed deputies."],["p","By then, Badaró’s family had been producing cacao for thirty years. The family knows nothing of the first Brazilian Badaró, except that he was born in Sicily and arrived in the eighteen-fifties. Of the second generation, they know of a son, Antônio, a man of visionary industry, who cleared the understory along the Rio Almada, twenty miles of a famously fertile tract where cacao thrives, and planted millions of trees.

Chocolate had become a wholly different food—a mass-market global confection—because a way had been found to make it with milk, previously impossible, owing to the fats’ absolute intolerance of anything with water in it. (People had been trying to mix chocolate and milk since cacao beans arrived in Seville; the model was probably coffee.) The trick was in manipulating the boiling point. In 1867, Henri Nestlé, in Vevey, on Lake Geneva, trying to create an infant formula that wouldn’t spoil, put milk in a sealed container, removed the air with a crude pump, and heated it until the water content evaporated. In a vacuum, milk boils at a lower temperature and doesn’t curdle. Nine years later, Daniel Peter, the town’s chocolate manufacturer, fed the formula to a newborn baby and understood an essential implication: a dried milk would not be rejected in cacao. Chocolate now had a populist formulation, its intensity diluted and dulled by sweet fats. It was an indulgence (fat + fat + sugar) and it was cheap (because milk was the principal ingredient), and by the time Peter’s Chocolate won a gold medal at an Amsterdam exhibition in 1883, people couldn’t get enough of it. By 1901, Peter’s Chocolate had a U.S. distributor and an unobstructed horizon to expand to. No American had figured out the boiling trick, although many tried, including Milton Hershey, whose milk kept curdling, until finally, after years of experiments, Hershey settled for what he could get: milk chocolate that was slightly soured but not entirely ruined. (To this day, American milk chocolate makes Europeans gag.) By 1905, Juca, Senhor, and Domingos were running Antônio’s estate. The same year, Hershey opened his new chocolate factory."],["ad",{"position":"mid-content"}],["p","The sons had never seen a northern chocolate factory. They didn’t know how to make chocolate. They didn’t eat it. But they had seen booms before: a raw resource is discovered (diamonds, gold, rubber) and is wanted on the other side of the earth—and many people had become rich. Even the Rio de Contas had been mined for diamonds. Cacao was just the next thing. There was a rush to get to Bahia before others got there first."],["p","In twenty years, the region went from producing almost none of the world’s cacao to most of it. Ilhéus—a provincial port in 1885 (sugar, coffee, timber)—became a boom town, with gaudy baroque mansions, cacao barons, night life, a celebrity prostitute, towering warehouses, harbor congestion, brokers, lawyers, tax inspectors, the agencies and excesses of sudden wealth."],["p","All of this appears in the work of Jorge Amado, the region’s chronicler. Amado’s family moved to Ilhé-us in 1914, when he was two, after a major flood destroyed their plantation; he died in 2001, at eighty-eight, after generating thirty-two books, seven movies, and a soap opera watched by twenty-five million. At the heart of Amado’s region is the high drama of a flawed squatter’s right: all property had been acquired by possessing, then defending—possibly a reasonable practice in 1850, definitely a dangerous one later, when desperate arrivals believed chocolate would make them rich. Claims had been filed at the Cartório de Ofícios, in Itabuna. Between 1905 and 1910, it burned down: no records, anarchy, and everyone at war with everyone else. It was rebuilt; new claims were received; it burned down again. Cacao made Amado into a writer—and in an introduction to “The Violent Land” (1943) he expresses his debt. He doesn’t thank the Badaró family, although it is their stories he tells, using their real names, a dizzying feature to come upon for the first time, as if the novel were a history, and maybe it is. The Badarós, too, were at war. Their adversaries were the family across the river."],["p","At Monte Alegre, Badaró revealed that he had learned of a ninety-three-year-old Oliveira survivor, his head and neck still laced with hacking scars. He had retained a heavy bell that had been rung when his home was under attack, and he still spat when he heard his rivals’ family name. We made an effort to visit him—Badaró nervous, gravely imagining a reconciliation across generations—and then discovered that the man had died. A granddaughter owned a restaurant near Ilhéus called Tocaia Grande, where she displayed the family weapons as trophies. In Bahia, ",["em","tocaia"]," has a historically specific sense, referring to a particular kind of isolated rain-forest assassination: a hired gunman, lying in ambush, in a land too big ever to hold him accountable. Amado’s father had been the target of a ",["em","tocaia;"]," it may have been partly why he fled the ",["em","fazenda"]," with such dispatch. There would have been no negotiation. You want a neighbor’s land? You kill him. Or you pretend to buy it, visit, bear a gift, and kill him. Or you offer property to a man who has never had it, often an ex-slave, provided he clears and cultivates it, and five years later, never having filed the claim, you kill him: an efficient way of planting trees."],["p","Katia, Badaró’s mother, growing up on an isolated cacao farm, had been kept ignorant of family history by a protective father, who died when she was sixteen. That year, she made a friend in school, Paloma Amado, the novelist’s daughter, and “the bell jar I had been living in shattered,” she told me. I met her brother, Badaró’s uncle, who had notions about the number of fatalities, but vague ones, because he, like other members of the family, had learned what he knew from Amado’s book. In it, two of Antônio’s sons are shot: Sinhô in a fight, Juca by ",["em","tocaia"],". The third son is not a character. This was the uncle’s grandfather and the man he was named after, Domingos: the pacifist, a quiet farmer and peacemaker, who, on New Year’s Day, 1910, ended the violence by marrying a member of the Oliveira family, Anita. According to Badaró’s uncle, she was a “remarkably ugly woman,” but one who “genuinely loved him. She was courted clandestinely—our own Romeo and Juliet—and their marriage ended the cacao wars.”"],["p","Diego Badaró didn’t read Amado’s novel until 2003, the year he decided to devote his life to cacao and needed to understand the burden of his family’s legacy. By then, most members had abandoned the rain forest, in the aftermath of witches’-broom."],["p","Witches’-broom appeared in 1989. It is a fungus that attacks the tree and its fruit, often as it is about to be harvested (overnight, the pod shrivels into a stick and the leaves go brown—hence the name). There was no cure. Cacao is a monoculture crop in Bahia and has always been vulnerable to a sudden disease. The fungus, indigenous to Latin America, could have come from anywhere—a ship’s hold, the flatbed of a pickup truck, the bottom of a boot."],["p","Once the blight appeared, it spread with baffling efficiency, in all directions. In the second year, ten million trees were infected; half the harvest rotted and was thrown away. By its fifth year, the disease had reached forty-five million trees, eighty per cent of everything ever planted. Five billion dollars had been lost. There were suicides. People wanted out but had no exit. Banks had inventories of foreclosed properties that they couldn’t sell. The warehouses by the pier in Ilhéus were abandoned and now teeter dangerously, the windowpanes gone. The pier is closed, and access to it is roped off for fear of collapse. A hundred and fifty thousand people lost work. In a region so rural, they have no prospects and live on scavenged manioc root. You see the people on the mournful wet road to the sea, the stumps and trees of the original forest cleared a century ago to get the cacao to port, every few miles a plantation, once brazenly Brazilian, a bright turquoise or yellow, now faded to a ghostly pastel, overrun by packs of scrawny animals and occupied by barefoot families boiling water over fires on floors of manor-house bedrooms, the doors kicked out, the windows gone, the walls dissolving from exposure to the constant rain. The owners never appear_._ They can’t get rid of the land, and they can’t make money on it.

A yellow berry, a ",["em","caza"],", was so sweet and complex that it excited an entrepreneurial fantasy: should I try to export it? There were remedies: A leaf rubbed into a wound was an anti-inflammatory. A seed made into an infusion treated a headache, an unwanted pregnancy, a brain injury. “Ah, ",["em","catuaba"],",” Badaró declared, affectionately holding up a piece of wood. “I love this. It is very powerful!” ",["em","Catuaba"]," was an aphrodisiac."],["p","I asked about a thick rope, rolled up like a sticky black snake on the ground. It was wild tobacco, a wholly different species from the domesticated Virginia leaf. “The most effective natural insecticide in the world,” Badaró said. “I dust my plants with it.” I bought a three-inch chunk, scrutinized it—wet like motor oil—and popped it into my mouth. I sucked, recognized the flavor of aniseed, and chewed. The chewing released a heat not unlike a chili’s."],["p","It was a warm afternoon. We made for an exit by way of a butchers’ aisle—in a nose-to-tail art, the cuts, hanging graphically, were principally of the art’s nether regions. A girl with a basket of lemons abruptly stopped in front of me and poked one of the items, displayed on a tray of black-rimmed eyeballs. I’d kept chewing, and an interaction of some kind had occurred between the juices in my mouth and what had been released by the wild tobacco. My tongue had gone numb and the roof and inner cheeks were very hot. Sweat cascaded from my eyebrows, suddenly, as though a valvelike gland had been opened, and my pulse increased. I was also producing an unfamiliar saliva, which filled my mouth. I spit it out. We reached the street. Badaró, in white linen, crossed in front of me, his bright sleeves swelling in the breeze. My mouth filled again."],["p","Wild tobacco is toxic; in some countries it is banned. The toxin is an alkaloid, a bitter-tasting compound formed by the plant as a defense against being eaten by insects and animals. A plant defends itself in many ways. An alkaloid is the most extreme, principally a response to big threats, and of the twelve thousand alkaloids known to science—quinine, codeine, cocaine, caffeine, ephedrine, strychnine, and nicotine among them—most come from the tropically wooded twenty-twenty zone. Many, like wild tobacco (",["em","Nicotiana rustica"],"), originate in Brazil. An implicit dynamic was at work; every fruit, bark, seed, and root had a complexity you didn’t find in a temperate climate. It was defensive."],["p","In the dynamic, I understood cacao, the best-defended fruit in tropical botany. Its sugary seed lands on a rain-forest floor, exposed. It is subjected to the most congested predator traffic (and the highest concentration of microbes, fungi, and possible bacterial attack) on the planet. Cacao contains, unusually, not one alkaloid but several, including caffeine, found in many tropical plants, and theobromine, found in few. It has more than five hundred other chemical compounds, also mainly defensive in purpose. Their benefits were first described by Andrew Waterhouse, in a study, published in ",["em","The Lancet"]," in 1996_,_ that examined polyphenol content. A polyphenol is an antioxidant. Red wine has plenty: two hundred and ten milligrams. A forty-gram bar of dark chocolate has nine hundred and fifty-one. “There is such a concentration,” Harold McGee, the author of “On Food and Cooking,” told me, “that they create much of chocolate’s uniqueness—the bitterness, the astringency, the edginess, and other sensations that we don’t know about.”"],["p","I discovered some of them during the all-night drive from Salvador.

Was it the caffeine? I’d asked."],["p","No, too little. (A dark-chocolate bar has the equivalent of one cup of coffee.) Theobromine, he said."],["p","Although theobromine can cause cardiac arrest in dogs, it appears to affect the human nervous system in only modest ways. It creates a few undisputed physiological symptoms. It makes you pee, for instance. Cacao has pharmacological ingredients, including serotonin, the mysterious neurotransmitter of well-being; a cannabinoid component, similar to what is found in marijuana; and a neuromodulator, phenylethylamine, an amphetamine-like antidepressant. But the conventional view is that the quantities are too small to be significant. I felt unsupported by the science. But Badaró understood. So did his uncle Domingos. They ate the beans. Domingos sometimes ate nothing else for days. On the drive, Badaró had also offered me kola nuts, one of the original ingredients in Coca-Cola. “It will also make you alert.” Kola also has theobromine."],["p",{"class":"has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading"},"Fermentation has been around forever. It is older than cooking. It was probably the first method of food preparation. Fermentation transforms grapes into wine, grains into beer, wheat into leavened bread. It transforms a raw ingredient, often valued for its nutrition, into one valued for its taste. It yields vinegar, yogurt, sauerkraut, cheese, prosciutto, vanilla, and pickles. It occurs most readily in fruits, because they have, in abundance, the two essential elements: sugar and yeast. A yeast is on a leaf or a branch or in the air. It is the fine white powder on the skin of a grape, like a dust that you should wash off. At its most basic, fermentation is how sugar becomes alcohol."],["p","In the long history of the rain forest, every hunter-gatherer familiar with the cacao pod would have seen evidence of fermentation. The seeds, in their sugary envelopes, ferment effortlessly. But only Mesoamerican culture understood what to do with them, because it had been using fermentation to prepare foods and alcohols for thousands of years, possibly as early as 7000 B.C., and knew how to control it. Badaró’s process was fundamentally no different."],["p","He conducted it in his “laboratory.” It was a concrete shed. It had doorframes but no doors, an overhead light that had burned out, a temperature alarm that didn’t work, a digital thermometer that was broken, and five large wooden troughs, like pigpens. It was the responsibility of Pedro Jardin, who had been running Monte Alegre for four decades."],["p","Jardin was now seventy-two, evanescently thin, with high cheekbones and sad eyes. He rarely spoke and seemed never to smile. Jardin had grown up with cacao. By day, he was wrapped, from cap to bright rubber boots, in rain gear. One night, he surprised me. He was barefoot and stripped to the waist, bearing an old Winchester. A Colt revolver was tucked into his trousers. He also had a sawed-off double-barrelled shotgun with a Tommy-gun-style grip. He walked the river before bedtime, a stealthy patrol, tiptoeing in and out of the trees, and returned to lock everyone in for the night—a claustrophobic touch, I felt, until I was wakened by something hurling itself against my door. Each time the door was struck, it lifted off its hinges slightly—four or five times, a ferocious force—until whatever it was (animal? man?) went away."],["ad",{"position":"mid-content"}],["p","Jardin was waiting for us at the lab.

It could have been an exaggerated version of an English pub. There was a gas, mildly disconcerting. It singed the lungs but felt strangely pleasant."],["p","Schilling inhaled. “Aaah, get those acetic acids up your nose.”"],["p","One trough was full. The beans, about chest-high, were covered with banana leaves, a gently heaving green blanket, wrapped tight, an oven on high. The yeast plus sugar produced carbon dioxide, plus heat and alcohol. There were plenty of yeasts on the banana leaves, a rich source, an additional insurance that could kick-start a fermentation if it hadn’t already begun, or else add to it. There were yeasts in the slats of the trough, the natural ones in the wood as well as those left over from previous fermentations. The beans had yeasts. The humid tropical air had them. The forest had them. I thought about the yeast in bread. This approach seemed less about control than about attack."],["p","Badaró pulled back some leaves. The beans instantly released a more intense hit of everything we’d been smelling. It was alcoholic and vaporous."],["p","They were in their third day of fermentation, and were now purply, the sweet pulp almost entirely gone, although still gooey. “A ton,” Badaró said."],["p","“A ton?” Schilling and I both asked, and looked again, feeling compelled to do the banal calculation. “Two thousand pounds?” The beans were so compact."],["p","The full trough was separated from other empty ones by wooden slats. Badaró removed one so that he could shovel beans into the next space. No matter how tightly everything was wrapped, the beans on top were cooler than the ones at the bottom. By shovelling everything next door, Badaró was turning them over. Normally, Jardin would then hop inside, shuffling beans under his boots, poking a toe into corners, to insure that every bean was equally fermented. Other foods are not fermented in this way. In wine, yeast converts the sugars in grapes into alcohol. No one worries if some haven’t fermented. At the end, they, and the mashed skins and stems that remain, a shapeless purple sponge, are thrown out. With cacao, an infantry of yeasts converge on the pulp around a seed and convert it into alcohol—plus acids and carbon dioxide and heat, none of it important, because none of it is the point. The liquids drain away; the alcohol evaporates. The attack doesn’t stop. The seed is heated to a temperature rarely seen in the natural world. The shell is savaged and penetrated, until the tissue inside is invaded. At the end, the bean is the equivalent of the grapey mash. It has been reduced in size. It smells powerfully of vinegar. Its proteins have been disfigured. If you open one up, its insides look as though they’d been obliterated. In the devastation, the extreme intensities of cacao are converted to flavors."],["p","Badaró, meanwhile, was trying to fix his thermostat. He wanted to keep the temperature from exceeding a hundred and twenty-two degrees Fahrenheit, but he had no way of measuring it. The beans in the trough seemed hotter than that. I stared at them, trying to gauge how hot they might be, and then I did a thing that seemed strange at the time but was really just a misunderstanding. I took off my shirt, shoes, and pants, and, with my boxers on, I swung myself over the side and sank into the beans. They really were very hot."],["p","I had wanted to get a sense of what you went through to complete cacao’s strange fermentation, and had assumed that most people wouldn’t be wearing many clothes. Jardin stared at me with a look of apparent horror."],["p","Then Schilling removed his clothes, slipped into the beans, and was jubilant. “Yoni juice,” he said. “Yoni of cacao juice.” He filled his hands with beans, looked up, and poured them down on his face."],["p","Badaró then removed his clothes. He landed with an awkward splash. Three of us were in a trough that might comfortably accommodate an adult pig, and the fermenting cacao was up to our necks. Badaró had taken to invoking some god, humming in his deep voice. “We must immerse ourselves and connect to the Aztec gods,” he said. He disappeared, sinking below the surface.

She arrived on a Friday, wrapped bars until three in the morning, dizzy from the glue stick used to seal them, and returned to the airport on Sunday night. After the first distributor, others followed. (“They could now trust the neophyte manufacturer with his odd chocolates.”) The orders meant success, but also chaos. Schilling forgot to order wrappers.

The son was the project, “a visionary,” but with no register of risk, no future tense. “He couldn’t even spell the word ‘business.’ ” They had issues.

Then the mother moved there from Minnesota; the sister from California. “At least, I was still his business partner,” Holderman said. If she hadn’t been, she recognizes, she would never have seen Schilling, because, astonishingly, he was still pouring bars by hand.

They then bought a huge machine, costing two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, paid for by selling five per cent of the company to his mother’s six siblings (putting its worth at probably around seven million dollars).

He made bars sold in Whole Foods, hippie pharmacies, organic markets, and beside the cash registers of independent bookstores."],["p","He had an immodest vision that he couldn’t stop thinking about. It involved all the stripped, torched, desiccated, denuded, barren land of the ruined tropics. Why couldn’t he figure out how to buy it up, most of it worthless anyway, and replant it with cacao, and, in effect, reforest the planet with chocolate bars?"],["p","I had been advised about Schilling’s ambitions. “He has no limits,” Holderman had told me forcefully. She described a trip the two of them once took to visit her family in Pennsylvania, passing through the town of Hershey. She was silenced by the scale, memories of a childhood visit, the wonder of it all, and, turning to Schilling, was alarmed by his focus and what he appeared to be thinking: he seemed to be measuring his future against Hershey’s achievements. Schilling wanted to be a player, and not just a normal high-stakes player but an ideological one: someone who could change the world."],["p","On the morning of his clarity, Schilling called his father. For months, Papa Jon had been working out the details of a sale (“Frankly, I just wanted to get a good chunk of change”), even though it had never been approved by his son. “Let’s do it,” Schilling said, and by nightfall a deal was done—so quickly it seemed like a spontaneous act—and Hershey became Dagoba’s owner. The price was seventeen million dollars. Schilling was retained as a consultant."],["p","That night, Schilling met friends, broke down, and wept uncontrollably for twelve hours. He spent the next month defending himself from charges made by organic colleagues that he was a “sellout.” “How could I make a difference at Dagoba, working on such a small scale?” he said repeatedly, an incomprehensible argument to people who had no idea that he wanted to plant two or three billion trees and that he had the support of a goddess. Holderman, who got the news by group e-mail, was one of the few friends who were not surprised. “It was right on time, wasn’t it?” she said.

On a cold Monday night last November, a friend persuaded me to make the trip with him. The place was pleasant but unremarkable, with a gray tiled floor, wooden tables, and no tablecloths or printed menus. There was a self-service bar with meze priced by weight. Hot dishes were dispensed at a cafeteria-style counter by a hatchet-faced man in a chef’s hat. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe first sign of anything unusual was the _kisir_, a Turkish version of tabouli, which had an indescribable freshness and suddenly reminded you that wheat is a plant. The bitter edge of sumac and pomegranate extract, the tang of tomato paste, and the warmth of cumin, which people from the south of Turkey put in everything, recalled to me, with preternatural vividness, the _kisir_ that my aunt used to make. Likewise, the stewed eggplant dolmas resembled my grandmother’s version even more intensely, somehow, than those dolmas resembled themselves.\n\n\n\nFood, I should clarify, has never played a large role in my mental life. I enjoy a good meal as much as anyone, but I get so confused by nutritional, budgetary, ecological, ethical, aesthetic, and time-management concerns that I often subsist for weeks on instant oatmeal and multivitamins. Having read Proust, and also neuroscientists on the direct connection from smell and taste receptors to the hippocampus, I have long been aware that eating is, for many people, an emotionally and mnemonically fraught activity. But, that night at Çiya, I viscerally understood why someone might use a madeleine dipped in tea as a metaphor for the spiritual content of the material world. \n\n\n\nOverwhelmed by the _kisir_ and the dolmas, I wondered if the explanation lay in my past. Both my parents were born in Turkey, but I hadn’t been back for more than four years. I hadn’t gone to my grandmother’s funeral; I had been holed up in my apartment in San Francisco, writing a dissertation chapter about Proust—Proust, who wrote so movingly about losing a grandmother! Now, belatedly returning to my parents’ homeland, I found myself not on the Black Sea, where my grandmother was born and buried, or in Ankara, where she lived, or in my father’s home city of Adana, where my aunt still lives. Instead, I had come to Istanbul, a city with which I had many romantic associations but little practical experience. Perhaps the meze reminded me of an irretrievable time when my aunt and my grandmother had cooked for me, and I had been where I was supposed to be in the world.\n\n\n\nAs the meal progressed, the tastes grew stronger and more varied. One inscrutable salad contained no recognizable ingredient except jewel-like pomegranate kernels, nestled among seaweed-colored, twig-shaped objects and mysterious chopped herbs, nutty and slightly bitter. A stew uniting beef, roasted chestnuts, quince, and dried apricots in an enigmatic greenish broth tugged at some multilayered memory involving my mother’s quince compote. I kept looking around the room for some clue to what was happening. Half the tables were empty; near us sat a few Turkish families, a handful of lone diners with books, and two Italian backpackers. There were some restaurant reviews on the walls, and a portrait of Atatürk, and a shelf with a row of jars bearing handwritten labels—“Dried Quince,” “Pickled Deer-Mushrooms,” and many terms I didn’t recognize, which I copied into a notebook. \n\n\n\nAt the end of the meal, we were served glasses of a pale-green herbal tea, the taste of which we couldn’t quite place. In the window was an array of marvellous, doll-like desserts. Candied tomatoes, dull-red translucent disks, resembled ancient talismans. Miniature candied eggplants had a troublingly sentient appearance, inky and squidlike. _Kerebiç_—round cakes with pistachio filling—were served with a gooey sauce. My friend thought it might be whipped cream; I thought it was some kind of high-end marshmallow. Finally, I asked a waiter. He said it was made from “the pulverized root of a local tree from Antakya.”\n\n\n\nBack home, I hit the Internet. I learned that the jars contained such substances as milk thistle, gallnuts, pickled wild capers, hyssop, and _mahlep_ (a spice made of ground cherry stones). I learned that the green herbal tea was made with thyme leaves, and that the food at Çiya exercised a violent effect on all kinds of people, not just bad Turkish granddaughters. One article described the reaction of “an eighty-five-year-old auntie who noisily burst into tears saying, ‘This is the dish my grandmother used to make,’ ” and a man in his seventies who was transported back to a meal he had eaten at the age of five. Tapping into a powerful vein of collective food memory, Çiya was producing the kind of Turkish cuisine that Turkey itself, racing toward the West and the future, seemed to have abandoned.\n\n\n\nVariously described as a “laboratory of Anatolian cuisine,” an “ethnographic museum,” and “the garden of lost cultures and forgotten tastes,” Çiya is the creation of Musa Dağdeviren, a forty-nine-year-old chef from southern Turkey, who has masterminded an ambitious project to document, restore, and reinvent Turkish food culture. Since 2005, he and his wife have been publishing a quarterly magazine, _Yemek ve Kültür_ (“Food and Culture”). Each issue includes a section titled “Seven Forgotten Folk Recipes,” collected by Musa during periodic forays that have taken him from the Balkans to the Caucasus, and during which he has rescued from obscurity various wild greens, sausages, yogurts, and cheeses. In Erzurum, he once discovered a forgotten kind of doughnut.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nI met Musa a few weeks later, on a rainy December morning. He was wearing a wool sweater over an oxford shirt, and reading glasses hung from a cord around his neck, making him look like someone’s good-natured Turkish uncle. Solidly built, with a vigorous black mustache, he projected both shrewdness and a complete lack of guile. \n\n\n\n\n\nMusa was born in the provincial city of Nizip in 1960. He sometimes slips into a southern Turkish accent, replacing “k” with “g.” His father, who grew olives and pistachios, was an ethnic Kurd, but Musa doesn’t identify himself as half Kurdish. His culinary motto is “Food has no ethnicity, only geography,” and his writings contain many diatribes against the claims of various groups to have discovered or invented certain techniques—claims that he thinks represent people’s need “to find reasons that they’re better than others.”\n\n\n\nMusa began working in a _lahmacun_ bakery belonging to an uncle at the age of five, sweeping under the racks of cooling loaves. “It’s a job for children between the ages of five and seven,” he explained. “After age eight or nine, they can’t fit under there.” Today, when he walks through Antep or Adana, he can recognize the children who work in bakeries, because of the burned flour between their toes. I asked whether children ever got burned. “It happens,” he said. “I have scars.” He seemed about to roll up his sleeve, then changed his mind. \n\n\n\nWhen Musa was twelve, his father died in a car accident. His mother was left to bring up six children herself, and Musa, the youngest, left school and started working, full time, in restaurants owned by his uncles. He describes his mother as his first master chef. She taught him to make vinegar, pickles, dolmas, noodles, and _mumbar—_sheep intestines stuffed with ground meat or liver, onion, and bulgur or rice. Musa told me that, a few years ago, when his mother died he went back to Nizip and stayed with a nephew, whose wife made a traditional springtime dish of fava beans and eggs. “When I tasted it, that’s when I realized that my mother was dead,” he said. “I realized that I was never going to taste that dish again the way my mother made it. The person who makes the food—his physique, his soul—is unique. It’s like fingerprints, or handwriting.”\n\n\n\nMusa came to Istanbul in 1979, at the age of nineteen. For the next eight years, he worked his way up through various Istanbul kitchens. In one essay, discussing the education of a Turkish chef at the time he entered the profession, he describes a fifteen-to-twenty-year climb through a rigid hierarchy, from errand boy to dishwasher, from apprentice to chef, and on to head chef and master chef. (Today, most of his employees are culinary-school graduates, but he still makes them start by washing dishes and peeling vegetables.) Around year six, a dishwasher either gets promoted to apprentice or remains a dishwasher forever. The apprentice learns his craft by studying the chefs—some of whom, however, deliberately resist study. If a clever apprentice tries to deduce how many eggs went into a dessert by counting the eggshells in the garbage can, a still cleverer chef, fearful of competition, takes to grinding all his eggshells into a powder. Masters also test apprentices by giving them absurd instructions. Musa once saw an apprentice, on a master’s instruction, put a whole sheep into a pot to boil with some beans.\n\n\n\nA few years after opening his first restaurant, Çiya Kebap, in 1987, Musa married one of his regular customers. The Dağdevirens, who have one daughter, now run three restaurants: Çiya Kebap, Çiya Kebap II, and Çiya Sofrasi. Çiya Sofrasi opened in 1998 and specializes in regional home cooking (_sofra_ means “dining table”). There is a wide gap in Turkey between restaurant food—grilled kebab or fish, and meat pastries like _börek_ and _lahmacun_, all of which are typically prepared by men—and the food that people eat at home: stews, pilafs, and dolmas, typically prepared by women. Until recently, it was difficult to find home-style food in restaurants. Perhaps this disjunction explains some of the cathartic experiences of Çiya customers. “Sometimes one of them will start crying, and it spreads to other tables,” Musa said.\n\n\n\nFor the past ten years, the Dağdevirens have been receiving lucrative offers to open restaurants in the trendy Beyogýlu and the touristic Sultanahmet neighborhoods, on the European side of the city, but Musa refuses to open a restaurant where he can’t personally drop in every night—so the three Çiyas occupy a single block on a narrow pedestrian street in Kadiköy’s market district.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nOne Wednesday in late December, I joined Musa for an excursion to Kandira, two hours east of Istanbul, on the Black Sea coast. The region is particularly rich in small villages, whose residents bring their food products to town to sell at the market every week. We drove through the bustling town center, past a school and a field where children were playing soccer. Small farms lay on either side of a dirt road. The market occupied a vast area under a yellow-and-white canopy. Inside, the canopy was supported by bright-blue scaffolding, from which light bulbs were strung on wires. Musa was looking primarily for foraged herbs. “There are forty or fifty women who gather them in the villages, and sell them here. They transform their poverty into riches. The people have adapted to the geography. They know how to make sweets using syrup from the inside of tree bark. They can make soup out of the buds of trees.”\n\n\n\n\n\nHe held up a bunch of greens. “We call this snake’s pillow, or snakeweed, or heathen’s beet,” he said. He tore off a leaf and handed it to me. It tasted fresh and not unpleasant. \n\n\n\n“No, don’t chew it!” he shouted. “Spit it out! Spit it out!”\n\n\n\nI furtively deposited the half-chewed leaf in a nearby pile of detritus. My mouth was filled with a burning, numbing sensation. \n\n\n\n“It’s actually a poisonous plant—you can poison someone with the roots, but it makes a delicious soup,” Musa said. “The leaves will burn you if you eat them raw. That’s a joke I like to play on people.” People on whom he has played this joke include Carlo Petrini, the creator of the Slow Food movement: “He liked it so much he bought a big bag of it to take to Italy to give to his friends.” \n\n\n\nI asked Musa about his relationship with Slow Food. “I like Petrini,” he said. “His values, his way of thinking are similar to mine.” But Turkey has its own branch of the Slow Food movement, whose adherents he is more skeptical of. “They go to villages and they find regional ingredients, but what do they do for the people?” he said. “Maybe the region has good honey, but its ovens are bad, or its schools are bad, or its roads are bad. What’s it like for the person who lives there? If you don’t keep the person alive, the honey will die, too.” \n\n\n\nMusa also expressed concerns about various aspects of fine-dining culture. “If you ask for olive oil, suddenly there appears some kind of a _dégustateur_ with three different bottles, telling you, ‘This is from this region of France, that is from that region of Italy,’ ” he told me. “We have an expression to describe people like that: ‘He’ll paint his own mother and sell her back to his father.’ ”\n\n\n\nWe made one round of the wild-greens sellers. Most were women, wearing bright flowered head scarves, oversized wool cardigans, and long skirts or baggy pantaloons. Musa asked their names, and how many people had worked to gather the greens, and how long it had taken, and how much they wanted per kilo. Most of the other buyers were women, and Musa, with his air of courtesy, familiarity, and botanical expertise, struck a discordant figure. As he talked to the sellers, he pointed out to me the best products and the best prices. There was a particular discrepancy between prices of corn poppy, whose Turkish name, _gelincik_, means “little bride.” “It’s a relative of hashish,” Musa explained. “It’s hashish’s grandfather.” \n\n\n\nAfter a second circuit, during which he bought a total of thirty kilos each of borage and mallow, seven kilos of corn poppy, six kilos of curly dock, and twenty bunches of watercress, Musa seemed to relax. He made some sundry purchases: buffalo-milk yogurt and two kinds of honey, one made with chestnut and linden flower, the other with chestnut and rhododendron. Near the beekeeper’s table, a farmer was selling live turkeys. There were seven or eight of them sitting on a row of crates, occasionally nodding their heads and gurgling, like members of a jury. In Turkey, the turkey is called _hindi_ (“Indian”) and is often roasted on New Year’s Eve, which was two days away.\n\n\n\n“Do you have any females?” Musa asked the turkey farmer.\n\n\n\n“Females, yes, females and males.”\n\n\n\n“Which ones are females?”\n\n\n\n“Well . . . these are males.”\n\n\n\n“I don’t want males.”\n\n\n\n“There’s some more turkeys in the back.”\n\n\n\nWe followed the farmer to a parking lot, where some more turkeys were standing in a trailer. “Some of these are female?” Musa asked.\n\n\n\nThe farmer scratched the back of his neck, and picked a turkey up by the feet. “Here’s a good bird,” he said. \n\n\n\n“It’s a male, isn’t it?” It gradually emerged that these turkeys were males, too—the females were all back in the village.  \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoons\u002F593b63758a032b339a0cd4b2]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\n“We’ll get something to eat now and then we’ll go to the village,” Musa said, adding that the difference in taste between a male and a female turkey is as big as a mountain. \n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nFor lunch, we walked to the town center, which Musa described as “authentic,” his highest term of praise. There were three busy commercial streets, whose businesses were all local. “There aren’t any streets like this left in Istanbul. Look, they have a _simit_ oven, and no Simit Sarayi.” A _simit_ is a pretzel-like ring of bread covered in sesame seeds. Simit Sarayi (_saray_ means “palace”) is a ubiquitous Turkish chain whose owners have plans to expand into Europe. “They sell what I call _pastane simit_”—a _pastane_ is a French-style pastry shop—“and now that’s what people are used to,” Musa said. “In the old days, every region had its own way of making _simit_. There’s an incredible variety of _simit_, and it’s all being lost.”\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonally, I rather like Simit Sarayi, the Starbucks of _simit:_ it has ubiquity, high turnaround, reliable quality, standardized service, and clean rest rooms, whereas a local _simit_ bakery is usually a small dark room with an oven and a window. You have to interact with a stressed-out baker, and, if you come at the wrong time of day, the _simit_ are cold and rock-hard. \n\n\n\nI asked why it was good to have, say, fifteen regional varieties of _simit_ but bad to have fifteen regional varieties of olive oil. Musa said that the olive-oil varietals were marketed just to make a profit, whereas the _simit_ arose naturally, as a function of regional differences. \n\n\n\n“What if a boutique _simit_ bakery starts reproducing the fifteen regional varieties of _simit_ and selling them to rich people at a markup?” I asked. “Is that good or bad?”\n\n\n\n“Well, of course, those things happen. That’s capitalism. Everything is being commodified. But what I know is this: when big corporations become involved, it’s never good for quality. \n\n\n\n“Look at what happened to _gazoz_,” he added, alluding to an indigenous carbonated soft drink. Musa’s article on the subject, “Don’t Touch My Gazoz!,” is an elegy to the golden age of the republic, when every city in Turkey, intoxicated by the introduction of carbonated beverages from Europe, hastened to invent its own local soft drink. “Every region gave rise to its own _gazoz_, known by its own name,” he writes. “Each region’s _gazoz_ was unique, and was made with the water from its own soil.” Izmir’s _gazoz_, Cincibir (pronounced “gingibeer”), was flavored with ginger, Nigýde’s with raspberry. The glass bottles came in different colors and shapes, and were objects of beauty. Musa describes the “terror and curiosity” with which he and his childhood friends experienced their first _gazoz_-flavored burps, and the pleasure, as an adult, of arriving in a new city, visiting its tea garden, and sampling the _gazoz_, whose flavor became inseparable from the memory of the place itself. Today, the Turkish _gazoz_ market, much like the American cola market, is dominated by two corporate brands: Uludagý (once a regional _gazoz_ maker, and now a national soft-drink giant) and Çamlica (part of the Ülker snack-food empire). Both have an amorphously fruitlike flavor reminiscent of Juicy Fruit gum.\n\n\n\nMusa paused outside a fish shop, where piles of silver anchovies and reddish-gold mullet lay in bins of ice. Noticing a folding table in the back, he suggested that we go in for lunch. As the owner fried an enormous portion of fish, I contemplated the problem of _gazoz_. Some of the old brands are, in fact, being resurrected, but of course the golden age described in Musa’s essay is fundamentally irrecoverable. It’s difficult to see any future for _gazoz_ other than corporate distribution or, perhaps, elevation to a niche commodity sold by specialty stores. And it would be hard to imagine Musa viewing with delight the appearance, in expensive tea gardens, of _dégustateurs_ trained to advise diners on their selection of _gazoz_ varietals. But, out of a similar impasse, Musa created Çiya: an idyll that owes its existence to his seemingly impossible expectations.\n\n\n\nThe shop owner brought the fish, which had been fried in cornmeal. Musa ate in moderation, but with quick, restless, almost peremptory movements. Finally, pushing his plate aside, he began to tell me about the Ottoman houses of Safranbolu, a five-hour drive to the east; formerly a vibrant mess, they had been cleaned up for tourists, and are now a *UNESCO*{: .small} World Heritage site. “Nobody lives there anymore—it’s all pensions and hotels,” he said. “You might go to a place like that once, just to see it, but you won’t go back a second time.” The moral of his story was that “the moment you say, ‘Hey, let’s revive this’—no matter what it is—it’s finished.” This is exactly the paradox that Çiya has avoided. “The people’s” lost food is rescued not only from disappearance or mechanization but also from foodie fetishism. The restaurant is an ark in which every tiny species is salvaged, represented, preserved—but still alive, changing, and growing.\n\n\n\nMusa, who read Hegel as a young man, sees the plight of food culture in Marxist terms. The forces of industrialization and commodification have alienated people from what they eat, and labels like “organic,” while seeming to offer the promise of overcoming alienation, end up as yet another market-imposed barrier between people and food. Musa’s parsley suppliers, a family who have been growing parsley from their own seeds since 1909, recently asked him how they could go about making their product “organic.” \n\n\n\nMusa’s magazine writings, full of veiled polemics against obliquely identified opponents, revolve around these problems. His monograph on _keşkek_—defined in the dictionary as “a dish made by slowly boiling well-beaten wheat, together with meat”—is less about boiled wheat than about a process unfolding over a certain geography. Musa has identified twenty-four regional names for _keşkek_, which may be eaten at funerals or weddings, on New Year’s, Muhammad’s birthday, Easter, or Ramadan; in the Turkish bath, during rain prayers, or in honor of special guests. In some villages, _keşkek_ is cooked at home and eaten with walnuts; in others, villagers bring their _keşkek_ to a communal oven that is operated only seven days a year. _Keşkek_ is sometimes cooked in vats with pickle juice, or, like rice, with chickpeas and cumin. “There are dishes without wheat that are still called _keşkek,_” Musa writes. He later told me about a kind of dessert _keşkek,_ made with dried fruit instead of meat. The facts of the dish, resisting definition, turn out to be almost incidental. What really interests Musa about _keşkek_ is that it embodies a living series of social functions. \n\n\n\nIn one rather strange passage, Musa exhorts the dish to defeat the spectre of culinary fusion: “How can we deny you, how can we ignore you, O _keşkek!_” he writes. “No matter how many wits there are who call you ‘risotto,’ you always knock them dead with your true meaning.” Musa despises fusion, a concept that, in his view, treats culinary traditions not as living processes but as finite objects to be manipulated in the name of creativity or revolution. As Musa sees it, _keşkek_ risotto is the invention of someone who can’t fathom the incredible richness of _keşkek_, and thinks it needs to be given a Western twist.\n\n\n\n“Our people are ashamed of themselves,” he remarks, alluding to Turkish chefs’ penchant for Western cuisine. “They have a complex. Go to Iran—you’ll find characteristic Iranian regional cooking. Here you open a book called ‘Modern Turkish Cooking,’ and the first recipe is for risotto.”\n\n\n\nThe other side of this shame, he continues, is false pride, which recently gave rise to an “Ottomania” fad, with restaurants claiming to serve the dishes of Sultan Suleyman’s court. There are, he says, no surviving recipes from Suleyman’s court: “People just want to think that they’re the descendants of kings.” Musa is particularly outraged by people who claim that their ancestors invented various foods. His latest historical work debunks the origin myth of _döner_ kebab, the rotating roasted meat that forms the cornerstone of Turkish street food: a chef called Iskender is supposed to have invented it in Bursa, in the eighteen-sixties. Once, at a symposium, Musa met a descendant of Iskender. “He was talking about how his ancestor, who was born in 1848, invented _döner_ kebab,” Musa told me. “He had no sources. He was just going around saying this.” Combing libraries, used bookstores, and flea markets, Musa found _döner_ represented in an 1850 engraving and an 1855 photograph. “I wanted to ask that guy, ‘So your grandpa invented _döner_ when he was two years old?’ ”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nAfter lunch, we drove with the turkey farmer and his wife back to their village, which was called Bozburun. On the way, Musa bombarded the couple with questions. Were they Manavs (a formerly nomadic Turkic people)? They were. Did they have _keşkek_? They did. Did they prepare it at weddings?\n\n\n\n\n\n“No,” the woman said.\n\n\n\n“Yes,” the man said. “At weddings and on henna night.” (A bride is traditionally decorated with henna the night before her wedding.)\n\n\n\nThe questions continued. Did they bake bread with potatoes or flour, with packet yeast or their own yeast? What did they eat at weddings and at funerals? What kind of mushrooms did they pick? How did they make pickles? \n\n\n\nWe turned onto a dirt road that led to the village.\n\n\n\n“Foreigners live in that house,” the woman said suddenly, pointing out of the car window.\n\n\n\n“Foreigners? Where are they from?”\n\n\n\n“Istanbul. They were born there, and then they came here.”\n\n\n\nWe reached a small green farmhouse. In front stood a stone oven, where (using packet yeast) the family bakes its bread. We proceeded along a driveway, muddy from recent rain, to the back of the house.\n\n\n\nBehind the house lay a patch of hilly grassland, near a creek. Turkeys were wandering everywhere, producing their strange ambient gurgle, under the lugubrious eye of a large German shepherd. Musa pointed out the four female turkeys he wanted. The farmer’s wife handed the first one to her husband, who bent down and swiftly cut off its head with a sharp knife. A loud wheezing came from the stump of the neck, which emitted irregular spurts of blood. The dog stood up slowly and ambled over. \n\n\n\n“_Hoşt!_” the farmer shouted. This is a Turkish word used exclusively for the purpose of chasing away dogs—there are different words for chasing away cats and poultry—but this dog did not respond. Finally, the farmer tossed the turkey’s tiny head some distance away, and the dog went off to look for it. The farmer’s wife handed him the next turkey. \n\n\n\nThe other turkeys seemed to view these developments with mild concern. Those which had been walking in the direction of the creek casually changed course and walked elsewhere, with one exception: a stately male, with a red wattle and an enormous fan of back feathers, marched pompously, deliberately, almost sinisterly before the scene of carnage. “What could he be thinking?” Musa asked.\n\n\n\nWhen all four turkeys had been killed, the farmer wiped the blood off his hands. He, his wife, their twelve-year-old daughter, and Musa began plucking the birds. I decided to join them. I had never defeathered a bird before. The turkey was still warm and twitching; its bare skin felt eerily human. Plucking all the turkeys took an hour. The farmer charged Musa about five dollars a kilo, which seemed like a good price, except he insisted that each bird weighed ten kilos. To me they seemed to be about six kilos. “More like four, not counting the bones,” Musa said, in the car. “But they were nice people, and this way you got to see authentic village life.” \n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nOn the drive back to Istanbul, we took a scenic route through the countryside, so we could stop by a property that Musa had recently bought in order to realize his long-cherished dream of a Turkish culinary institute. The idea was to provide a center for Turkish food culture: a school, a library, a research institute, and a publishing house. Above all, Musa wants to see the history of Turkish cuisine chronicled in print. “We need records,” he said. “The French have them, but we don’t. Our first cookbook, the ‘Melceüt Tabbâh’in,’ was written by a doctor—not a chef—and published in 1844. The French had books on French cooking in the sixteen-fifties. In the seventeen-fifties, they had a book on _bourgeois_ cooking. We didn’t even have a bourgeoisie, and they already had books about what the bourgeoisie ate.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Our history is such a mess. It’s like an Arab’s hair,” he continued. “That’s what we say when something is tangled. You’re right, that’s not a good expression—it’s offensive to Arabs. Here’s a better expression. A camel was asked, ‘Why is your neck crooked?’ The camel replied, ‘What part of me _isn’t_ crooked?’ You can’t pick out the mistakes anymore, because mistakes are all there is.”\n\n\n\n“That’s a great expression,” I said. “Although maybe offensive to camels.” \n\n\n\n“Why should camels be offended? It’s the objective truth. The camel said it himself. That’s the difference between the camel and our food historians. The camel sees himself accurately.”\n\n\n\nBy the time we reached the property, night had fallen. We came to a pair of imposing metal gates and Musa rang a bell, several times, to no effect. Banging on the gates with his fist, he began shouting to someone called Ismail. Then he picked up a rock and started beating it against the metal. After five minutes of this, the groundskeeper, who is hard of hearing, appeared, bowing and apologizing. “I must have fallen asleep,” he said, unlocking the gate. \n\n\n\nInside, rows of fruit trees stretched into the gloom, interspersed with plots of furrowed earth that will someday be a living encyclopedia of Anatolian plant life—Musa is currently negotiating with various Istanbul universities to found a seed bank here. The school will offer joint degree programs and master classes. A mansion loomed before us, and Musa stopped the car, leaving the headlights on. As we walked toward the mansion, I became aware of the presence all around us of enormous, shadowy formations, which proved to be topiary animals. A monstrous dolphin reared on its tail in the middle of the circular drive, and, in the murk, I thought I could make out a stag and a bear on the lawn.\n\n\n\n“The guy we bought the land from— he was really rich. It was his hobby to cut the bushes like that,” Musa explained. “I told him he could keep doing it if he wanted. I think he’s been back a few times.”\n\n\n\nEntering the mansion, he switched on the electric lights and, one by one, rooms materialized around us. Musa told me his plans for a library, a reading room, a kitchen with stations for students, conference rooms, lecture halls, editorial offices. There would be guest rooms for visiting scholars and writers. He and his family would live on the top floor. He showed me a spot he was considering for his desk, in a window overlooking a giant topiary alligator. Back downstairs, he lingered a moment in the front hall before turning off the lights. Everything dissolved again into darkness, and we got back in the car to return to Istanbul. ♦","canonicalUrl":"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fmagazine\u002F2010\u002F04\u002F19\u002Fthe-memory-kitchen","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1f7d22d4972cd5b83524","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1f7d22d4972cd5b83524","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Cooks","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"cooks"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Cooks","parent":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"cooks"},{"id":"5c2e1c79ee7fe02cbd163329","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c79ee7fe02cbd163329","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Food","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"food"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Food","parent":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"food"},{"id":"5c2e1cd37e716b454591ae2e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1cd37e716b454591ae2e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Istanbul","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"istanbul"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Istanbul","parent":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"istanbul"},{"id":"5c2e31298c8f962cd419cd84","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e31298c8f962cd419cd84","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Madeleines","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"madeleines"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Madeleines","parent":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"madeleines"},{"id":"5c2e1f6841c92e2c9b85dc84","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1f6841c92e2c9b85dc84","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Marcel

One recent Saturday, Javier Plascencia, the leading chef in a movement seeking to rehabilitate the city’s reputation through its food, idled his car, a green Jeep Wrangler with a paper cutout of the Virgin of Guadalupe wedged into the instrument panel, in front of a stall. Purposeful middle-aged women in halter dresses jaywalked back and forth to hotels with hourly rates, and men—Mexican, American, European, Chinese—lurched around drunkenly. The barbecue billowed. Plascencia opened the window and breathed contentedly. “I get influenced by the smell,” he said. This particular open grill had suggested a note in a new dish: grass-fed Sonoran beef cooked sous vide for forty-eight hours, then seared and served with tiny California lentils, potato foam, and white chayote caramelized with Mexican vanilla. “I add charcoal oil to the beef so you get that smell,” he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTijuana, situated in northern Baja and separated from San Diego by the world’s busiest border crossing, has long been seen as a curious outpost, a city too far from mainland Mexico to be truly Mexican and too culturally distinct from San Diego to be American—a no man’s land, with the infrastructure of a failed amusement park. “In Tijuana, you don’t have that much to offer, in terms of monuments or museums,” Plascencia told me. “People don’t feel very proud of Tijuana, because it’s always been a town of alcohol, sex, and drugs, made up of everyone who wants to cross the border but can’t.” Unlike other Mexican states, whose food traditions go back hundreds of years and are rigidly codified—to change a mole recipe in Puebla would cause a culinary and academic scandal—Baja has no established regional cuisine. Plascencia’s mission is to define one and, in the process, turn Tijuana into a site of gourmet pilgrimage. “I’m trying to make Baja and Tijuana a food destination, like San Francisco,” he says. “I want to make an example, like, We can really do this.”\n\n\n\nGiven the city’s recent history, this is a particularly challenging task. Mexico is regarded as the world’s kidnapping capital, for everything from “express kidnappings,” perpetrated by amateurs who drive their marks to A.T.M.s to withdraw their own release money, to abductions by highly organized criminal gangs who hold victims in safe houses while they negotiate ransoms. Between 2006 and 2010, as the Tijuana cartel began to fragment and new factions sought to establish themselves, violent crime escalated. At the peak, in the fall of 2008, there were as many as two hundred killings a month. Well-to-do Tijuanans stayed home at night, and American tourists stopped coming altogether. Even now that conditions have improved—there are fewer homicides per capita today than in St. Louis—the popular perception of the city as unsafe remains. The U.S. consul general in Tijuana gets danger pay to fill his post, and tourism has not meaningfully revived. Drew Deckman, an American chef who has a restaurant in Cabo, told me, “Javier is doing everything he can in a city that’s been essentially condemned.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThis past January, Plascencia opened Misión 19, a forward-thinking restaurant with world-class ambitions. Plascencia’s cooking is technically adroit—his pantry is stocked with Sosa, a spherification agent that he uses to make jalapeño beads to accompany yellowtail sashimi—but also lusty. “There is a clear vision in Javier’s food,” the Chicago chef and PBS host Rick Bayless, who devoted an episode of his show to Plascencia, said. “It’s based on a sense of balance and a sensibility you find in classic Mexican food—never shying away from acid, embracing the tangy side completely—but casting those flavors in a modern presentation.”\n\n\n\n\n\nPlascencia is forty-four, handsome and sturdy, with dark hair and skin; friends call him El Negro. Black is his color, for jeans, sunglasses, work boots, and chef’s coat—which he often falls asleep in, on the couch in his apartment, after leaving the restaurant at 2 *A.M*{: .small}. He is quiet, with a boyish good nature, and, despite occasionally searching for a word in English, bicultural fluency. “He’s a conduit,” Steve Livigni, who runs a popular rum bar in Los Angeles, said. “He’s familiar.” He is also the only native of Tijuana I have heard refer to his city as TJ, the vaguely demeaning nickname favored by San Diego frat boys. \n\n\n\nLike other chefs of his generation, Plascencia is inspired by _materia prima:_ ingredients raised in the area he considers his territory, from Los Angeles to San Quintín, a fishing village a hundred and eighty miles down the Baja coast from Tijuana. At Misión 19, he refuses to serve salmon, a mainstay of the Tijuanan notion of an elegant meal—it is not indigenous—and he does not do family style. Meals at Misión 19 are made up of small, architecturally composed courses, paired with wine. For Plascencia, this is an act of Oedipal defiance: his father, Juan José, owns and operates nine restaurants, including a chain of family-style pizzerias and two fine-dining establishments that are responsible for a great deal of the salmon eaten in Tijuana. “Here I do what I want, whether you like it or not,” Plascencia says. “I will change my menu every week, and if you like a dish and it’s not on the menu anymore, then you will have another one.” \n\n\n\nIn July, Plascencia was at a street-food fair at the Rose Bowl, in Pasadena, wearing a black T-shirt with a yellow Pac-Man-like figure on it, and the motto “TJ Makes Me Hungry.” Decorating his booth was a large red banner with a list of words that describe his food: “sustainable,” “organic,” “artisanal,” “umami.” The other booths, including two from Baja, looked homespun by comparison, with fishing nets, lacquered abalone shells, and jars of hot sauce. Plascencia said he’d arrived at 4 *A*{: .small}.*M*{: .small}., with twenty-one hundred shucked Kumiai oysters from Laguna Manuela in the back of his car. At the festival, he grilled them, and sprinkled them with short-rib chicharrones, lemongrass foam, and ponzu sauce: oyster asada. The food writer Jonathan Gold came back for seconds. “That made my day,” Plascencia said. \n\n\n\nAt the end of the night, when awards were given out, Plascencia’s oyster asada took Best in Show. At his booth, friends passed around a bottle of mescal to celebrate, but he was nowhere in sight. A few minutes later, he wandered out of the dark. “What happened?” he said, smiling casually and pretending to be baffled. “I was taking a piss.” Bill Esparza, a saxophone player who writes the blog Street Gourmet LA and has been going to Tijuana to eat every few months for the past decade, had arranged for Plascencia to come north for the festival. “There’s a lot of people that don’t want to cross the damn border,” Esparza said. “So fuck it, we’ll bring ’em here.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nTijuana is a young city. It was founded in 1889, the year the Eiffel Tower went up. When Juan José Plascencia was born, in 1939, it had twenty thousand people; now, with 1.5 million, it is the third-largest city in Mexico. Its industrial parks, full of factories—Samsung, Philips, Toyota, Medtronic—employ tens of thousands. (Baja’s unemployment rate is five per cent.) Migrants have given Tijuana one of the most diverse produce markets in the country. Street carts offer Sinaloa-style raw seafood cocktails, and Sonoran steak culture, with its manly protein proportions, flourishes; in northern Mexico, carbohydrates are merely a condiment.\n\n \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoons\u002F593b60f9ba20a654ac5d4604]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nThe first eaters in Tijuana were the Kumiai, hunter-gatherers who occupied the area twelve thousand years ago, and dined on quail, hare, fish, and especially oysters, which they grilled, oyster-asada style, in the shell. “Shells are to Baja California what the pyramids are to the rest of Mexico,” a local winemaker told me: they constitute the archeological record. At the turn of the twentieth century, Chinese laborers were brought to nearby Mexicali to build the railroad and work in the mines. (The first border patrol, established in 1904, was intended to prevent them from entering the United States.) Now soy-lime-chile sauce is an area staple, and Tijuanans typically meet for Sunday lunch at Chinese restaurants, a ritual that Plascencia alludes to with a rich, punchy dish of roasted pork butt and belly, wrapped in a paper-thin masa crêpe and seasoned with tamarind hoisin. Japanese followed—their tempura recipes gave rise to the famous Baja fish taco—along with Italians, who brought oil and wine, and their way with noodles. Several of the Plascencias’ restaurants serve a delicious spaghetti taco that would seem impossible anywhere else in Mexico.\n\n\n\nProhibition in the United States turned Tijuana into a tourist destination, which attracted celebrity visitors like Clark Gable, Jean Harlow, and Al Capone, who frequented the Agua Caliente Casino, a Moorish-Californian structure with a golf course and a private airport. (Its minaret still stands, and is one of the few historic buildings left.) The tourist industry created a vogue for Vegas-style international restaurants, staffed with Italian waiters and French cooks. Caesar Cardini, an Italian restaurateur with places in Sacramento and San Diego, moved his operation to Tijuana in the early nineteen-twenties. He opened Caesar’s, a bistro with a long wooden bar and a black-and-white checkered floor, on Avenida Revolución—once known as the most visited street in the world—where American couples went for margaritas, sombreros, and a quickie divorce. \n\n\n\nThe first successful culinary export from Tijuana was the Caesar salad: hearts of romaine tossed tableside with coddled egg, oil, Parmesan, lemon, and crushed garlic, and designed to be eaten with the fingers, like asparagus. According to Julia Child, one of her first restaurant memories was of visiting Caesar’s with her parents around 1925. “My parents, of course, ordered the salad,” she wrote. “Caesar himself rolled the big cart up to the table, tossed the romaine in a great wooden bowl.” She went on, “It was a sensation of a salad from coast to coast, and there were even rumblings of its success in Europe. . . . Before then, too, salads were considered rather exotic, definitely foreign, probably Bolshevist, and, anyway, food only for sissies.” In 1953, a French epicurean society declared the Caesar “the greatest recipe to originate from the Americas in fifty years.” \n\n\n\nOver time, Revolución devolved into a depressing string of curio shops and discount pharmacies selling Cialis and Viagra. The waiters at Caesar’s, Plascencia told me, made salads with Kraft Parmesan from a green shaker. Not that anyone cared—most visitors were more interested in the strip club in the back. “They’d come in, buy their Viagra, have a Caesar salad, go to see the strip show, and maybe take a hooker and go to the hotel next door,” he said. “Our goal is to bring a better class of tourist. We don’t want the person who wants to spend five dollars for twelve beers. That’s already gone. We want to have a tourist that will spend a little more money, be more educated, buy better things.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nMisión 19 is a sleek space in the kind of contemporary building—board-formed concrete, eight-story light well—that you’d sooner expect to see in Barcelona or Tokyo than in Tijuana. In the restaurant, old beams from the railroad in El Rosario hang on wires from the ceiling, and the wine—nearly all of it from Baja, and all of it for sale in the building’s wine shop—is displayed on open shelves. Swinging doors lead to the kitchen, where glossy red retractable heat lamps brood over plates just off the line, waiting to be zhooshed with cactus dust. \n\n\n\n\n\nOne night in May, the walk-in cooler was full of organic padrón peppers from San Ysidro, California; bright-green sea beans from the coast off Ensenada; and mini-squashes with their blossoms clinging like spent balloons. On a blackboard in the back, someone had scrawled, in English, “We speak no Americano.” The restaurant was catering a party on the roof, a wine tasting with all the vintners represented in the building’s shop. Plascencia ran up and down the stairs, mingling with the winemakers and checking on his catering staff. Young professionals who work in the building—at Deloitte, which has its regional headquarters there, or at the energy company or the foreign exchange—milled around in pink gel light with college students in wrap dresses and stacked heels. A chilly desert wind whipped their skirts; the city glittered under a fingernail moon. On a catwalk above, a couple of d.j.s played along to projected images of Tokyo street scenes. \n\n\n\nCarlos Jaramillo, a thirty-six-year-old Tijuana native who studied international business at San Diego State and now works for the building’s developers, walked around greeting people. He had slicked-back hair, sharp green eyes, and wore a gray Marc Jacobs windbreaker and dressy rubber-soled walking shoes. In his view, Tijuana’s ascent is inevitable. “We’re the only city on the border where the city on the U.S. side, which is San Diego, is bigger than the one on the Mexican side,” he said. “We border the largest economy in the world, so imagine the dynamism of this area. This place should be the next Hong Kong.”\n\n\n\nJaramillo told me that the developers had interviewed chefs from as far away as Mexico City, before realizing that Plascencia was right for the project. “He’s young, his food is so international, he has travelled the world,” Jaramillo said. “He represents Tijuana.” He went on, “Now a lot of chefs are rock stars and they’re doing P.R. What we like about Javier is that he’s still sweating in the kitchen.”\n\n\n\nDuring the dinner service, Plascencia positions himself by the heat lamps and, wielding a pair of large tweezers and a foamer, beautifies plates of meat and starch, like a cosmetologist backstage at a pageant. He touches, tastes, sends back. “Presentation is a big thing,” he says, but he is equally invested in the more basic side of dining: consumption. When the bussers bring the first plates back from the dining room, he moves over to a spot between the dishwashing station and the trash. “If the food is not all the way gone, I say, ‘What happened?’ ” he told me. “That’s how I measure my success.” \n\n\n\nMeals at Misión 19 often begin with a parfait, served in a tall fluted glass, inspired by a sundae that Plascencia’s thirteen-year-old son ordered on a trip to Ghirardelli in San Francisco: scallops with Greek yogurt, lemon curd, globs of brown soy gel, salt-cured nopales, and avocado meringue. On top he sprinkles corn chips ground up with chiltepín, a super-hot brown pepper from Sonora. “I like to start my meals with something like this,” he told me once, shadowboxing. “_Arrrgh!_” \n\n\n\nThe food at Misión 19 is a deliberate challenge to the conservative palates of the businessmen who eat there: Plascencia has been known to serve sea-urchin ice cream and a “surf and turf” aguachile of shrimp, scallops, and grasshoppers. “We’re still teaching people how to eat,” he says. His father, Juan José, has been there only a few times, and he grimaced slightly when I asked him about it. “I would not invest in that kind of restaurant,” he said. \n\n\n\nNot long ago, I sat down on a Friday night with a group of attractive Tijuanans in their mid-thirties. The men were in business; the women, when I asked them what they did, called out “Housewives!” in joyous unison. They had just finished a course of beef shanks filled with roasted marrow, topped with bluefin-tuna tartare and serrano foam: Bamm-Bamm goes to Nobu. “We were thinking, like, wait,” one of the women said. “Usually, when we eat bone marrow we eat it with a tortilla or a piece of bread.” \n\n\n\n“Marrow is lowbrow,” her husband said.\n\n\n\n“How are you going to put a sashimi on a tortilla?” the woman continued. “That just doesn’t go! We actually said that to the waiter, and the waiter said, ‘With a spoon—just eat it with a spoon. You don’t need the bread or tortilla.’ We were surprised at the combination. We thought, Pretty good.” \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoons\u002F593b60fb0f529324ac062c02]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nJuan José Plascencia, who is known around town by his nickname, Don Tana, grew up going to Caesar’s: his godfather, an Italian restaurateur married to his aunt, had been one of the original employees, and owned it for a time in the forties. Juan José apprenticed himself to his godfather, and gradually taught himself to cook. He and his wife, Martha, would go to Filippi’s, a San Diego pizza parlor, and take notes: which ingredients were used, how long the pies cooked, and in what kind of oven. In 1969, they opened what they believed to be Mexico’s first pizzeria, Giuseppi’s, a low-ceilinged place with plastic grapes hanging from the rafters and red-and-white picnic cloths on the tables. Juan José cooked, and Martha was the hostess, waitress, cashier, and accountant. The space has expanded to seat three hundred, and Giuseppi’s, which now has five locations, is still a staple of family dining in Tijuana. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Plascencias raised their children to work in the restaurants. Juan, the eldest, plays host; Julian, a jazz bass player, books the live music and handles graphic design, marketing, and advertising; and Margu, the youngest, a perfectionist, is a pastry chef. Javier, the second oldest, takes after his father. He has always preferred to be in the kitchen, and, from the age of twelve, was responsible for making chorizo for the Mexican pizza at Giuseppi’s. “People came in with the pigs on their backs and put them on the table,” he said. “We had a butcher who cut and ground them; my job was to put in the spices—cumin and paprika and garlic—and I had to mix it all with a big paddle. Then we added soy, to give it more volume. I still remember the texture and, all over my hands, the smell. I used to be kind of fat, because I ate a lot of chorizo.”\n\n\n\nThe Plascencias moved their family to Chula Vista, just across the border, in San Diego County, in 1980, so that Javier, who had been expelled from school for putting a cherry bomb under his English teacher’s car, could go to a military school in Oceanside. “That was a kind of punishment,” Javier said. “But I had a lot of fun. I learned to surf there.” After a year, he went to a regular high school, and, like a regular American male with a sensitive streak in the eighties, went through a stage of wearing eyeliner, an earring, and a thrift-store trench. (The earring didn’t last; one Easter lunch, Martha noticed it and gave him such a look that he pulled it from his ear right at the table.) Educating their children in America was a priority for the Plascencias. “For the people born in Tijuana, it’s both a privilege and a necessity,” Juan José says. “In order to survive in your own city, you have to speak English.” \n\n\n\nJavier went to Mesa, a community college in San Diego, and, after living there for freshman year, moved back to Tijuana and commuted. “I was late every day for my first class,” he told me. As he was getting ready to go to the Culinary Institute of America, in New York, he met a Tijuana girl named Laura, and decided to stay home; they got married when he was twenty-one and she was eighteen and pregnant with their first child, Lauren, who is now twenty-two.\n\n\n\nIn 1988, as Javier was finishing school, Juan José and Martha decided to open a more formal restaurant, with a Mediterranean-Italian theme, in a fashionable mini-mall called Plaza Fiesta. They named the place Saverios—from the Italian for “Javier”—and he started working there, as an apprentice to the chef. In time, Juan José let him shape the menu. “I used to look up to Wolfgang Puck,” Javier told me. “He was a big star, and the food was really inventive.” After eating at Spago, Javier tried smoked-salmon and caviar pizzas at Saverios. He served pesto, sun-dried tomatoes, and cappuccino, which had rarely been seen in Tijuana. “We were pioneers,” he said. \n\n\n\nSaverios attracted a sophisticated, moneyed crowd, but also the gangsters known as “narco juniors,” children of rich families recruited by the cartels, identifiable by their mink vests, alligator-skin boots, and Tejano hats. Plaza Fiesta acquired the nickname Plaza del Balazo—Shooting Plaza—for the gunplay that occurred with increasing frequency. “We had to get out,” Javier said.\n\n\n\nThe family ultimately moved the restaurant to just outside Chapultepec, Tijuana’s nicest neighborhood, and in 2000 started building a fifty-thousand-square-foot faux palazzo on what was previously a junkyard. “People thought we were crazy,” Javier said. The resulting restaurant, renamed Villa Saverios, is an ornate, orange behemoth, with vaulted ceilings, brocade banquettes, an upstairs ballroom where wealthy families throw quinceañera parties, and a panelled private wine cellar where the mayor likes to have lunch with the governor or the chief of police. Occasionally, politicians from the country’s opposing parties, *PAN*{: .small} and *PRI*{: .small}, find themselves dining at the same hour. As at Rick’s Café, in “Casablanca,” discretion is a survival skill. Martha told me, “My husband says, ‘The *PRI*{: .small} thinks I’m a *PAN*{: .small} and the *PAN*{: .small} thinks I’m a *PRI*{: .small}, and I’m nothing.’ Javier is the same way.”\n\n\n\nAround the corner from Villa Saverios is Casa Plasencia, the Plascencias’ bullfighting-themed restaurant, which is named for a town in Spain with a name similar to theirs. It, too, is frequented by politicians and government officials, who congregate in a private dining room accessible from the parking lot by an outdoor staircase, while their bodyguards wait below in armored Suburbans and white Crown Victorias. Once, Martha told me, she arrived at the restaurant to find three pickup trucks full of masked soldiers in the lot, and the street closed to through traffic. “I said, ‘Oh, my God, they killed someone,’ ” she recalled. It turned out that two Army generals were dining in the upstairs room. “Imagine all the black! Our customers get scared,” she said. Still, she told me, “it’s supposed to be a privilege to have them here so often.” \n\n\n\nIn the past decade, crime began to change in Tijuana. David Shirk, who studies security at the Trans-Border Institute, at the University of San Diego, describes it as a transition from organized to disorganized crime. “It went from being highly sophisticated, lucrative, and, for the most part, unseen, to being much more brutal, in-your-face, democratic kind of crime, which affected lots of people and created widespread fear,” he said. Kidnappings, undertaken by amateur gangsters needing start-up money, became commonplace, and the city’s professional class came under assault. The Plascencias began to hear things: a customer had been kidnapped, his family forced to sell everything to raise a million-dollar ransom overnight. Two of their regulars appeared with missing pinkies, a sign that the money had not come fast enough.\n\n\n\nA year after Villa Saverios opened, Julian, who was twenty-nine, was driving home around midnight, having picked up the proceeds from two Giuseppi’s concessions. A car pulled in front of him and stopped, and another pulled up beside him. Three young men with guns got out. He sped away in reverse, smashing into parked cars, and then ran, leaving a document case full of cash. Still being chased, he jumped over a fence and into the back yard of a house. The owner came out with a gun, but his daughter recognized Julian and persuaded her father to let him in. When he got back to his car, he found the cash undisturbed. A few years later, in early 2005, Martha got a call from another woman named Plascencia, who told her a terrifying story. Her son had just been abducted by people demanding a large ransom from the family, which they knew had money because they owned so many restaurants. The boy tried to explain that his family wasn’t rich—they owned a carnicería that sold tacos out front—but his captors continued to beat and threaten him. His family sold their house to pay the ransom and moved to Arizona. The woman had called, she said, because it was clear to her that they had really wanted one of the Plascencia sons. \n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nMore than forty million people cross the border at San Ysidro every year. Crossing times, particularly given post-9\u002F11 security measures, are unpredictable. I have seen the pedestrian line stretch a few thousand people deep on the Mexican side on a Friday afternoon: a four-hour wait in the sun, with babies and luggage and nowhere to sit. Mexican workers sometimes spend five hours a day in the car in order to make fifteen dollars an hour doing construction in Oceanside or Carlsbad. \n\n \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoons\u002F593b60fd20855957e69d55b1]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nEven so, Tijuanans tend to view San Diego as a neighborhood in their city. They like to say, “What’s the best part of Tijuana? San Diego! What’s the most fun part of San Diego? Tijuana!” The kids grow up with American television and FM radio, using dollars instead of pesos, and going to the States to see movies. “When we were children, we couldn’t really tell one place from the other,” Julian told me. “We just crossed all the time. My mother would cross to buy milk.” \n\n\n\nThe reverse, of course, is not true. Tijuana has never been a normal place for Americans, always an escape or an entertainment or a vice. American visitors to Tijuana these days tend to be elderly Southern Californians seeking to take advantage of low-cost medical care and prescription drugs; when Whitey Bulger was arrested in June, he told the authorities that he and his girlfriend used to go to Tijuana frequently so that he could buy atenolol for his high blood pressure. \n\n\n\nOne weekday afternoon this summer, I drove down to the border from Los Angeles and parked my car in a lot at the turnoff marked “Last U.S.A. Exit.” In the lot there was a stop for the Mexicoach, a small van that, for four dollars, takes people to Avenida Revolución. During the ten-minute drive, a seventy-something woman wearing a floral blouse discussed with her husband the dental work he was going to have done. “I’m just so very grateful you made that connection,” she kept saying. As we drew near, a man started talking about seeing the federales on the street corners with machine guns. “Lots of people still think this is Afghanistan,” he said.\n\n\n\nAt the time that Martha got the phone call about the kidnapping, Javier and Laura had just bought a new house in Chapultepec, and she was pregnant with their fourth child. Juan José decided that it was time for the entire family to leave Tijuana for good. They sold their houses and moved back to Chula Vista, prepared to live as expatriates. “Chula Juana,” as it is sometimes known, is home to a large number of middle- and upper-middle-class refugees from Tijuana, living in vast new, gated tract-home developments, with beige stucco walls, fuchsia bougainvillea, lakes, parks, golf courses, and easy access to the 125, a toll road that takes you to the Otay Mesa border crossing in five minutes. Most of the new housing stock dates to the middle of the past decade, when the demand from Tijuana was at its highest and it was easy to get bank loans. Tijuanan doctors and lawyers own houses there, as do famous singers, boxers, movie stars, and politicians. As in Tijuana, people communicate by Nextel walkie-talkies (easier and cheaper than placing long-distance calls), and drive cars with Mexican plates. \n\n\n\nFor months, Javier didn’t cross back to Tijuana, but monitored the restaurants by Web cams that he had set up. Eventually, he started slipping in. “I used to ride my motorcycle when I didn’t want people to know I was coming,” he said. People in town gossiped, and said that the Plascencias had abandoned their restaurants, so Javier made a point of showing himself. He drove with a bodyguard following behind him, and tried to change his route often. “I was scared, but we’re restaurateurs,” he said. \n\n\n\nIn exile, the Plascencias were restless, so they decided to open a restaurant. Romesco, in Chula Vista, is a miniature Villa Saverios, with waiters in ties and satin waistcoats, live music, and a beautiful wooden bar, tucked incongruously into a strip mall, next to a Baskin Robbins. “San Diego is still Tex Mex and Taco Bell,” Javier told me. “My first menu at Romesco was really, really authentic. People didn’t get it. I had to explain a lot. People don’t know what a tomatillo is.” Juan José told him to tone it down—carne asada for the gringos, beef-cheek tacos, marlin, and tongue for the expats. Javier grew stir-crazy. “I became a really good golfer,” he said glumly.\n\n\n\nIn 2007, the Mexican government sent thirty-three hundred federal troops and policemen into Tijuana, and appointed a new chief of police, Julián Leyzaola Pérez. Working closely with the military—he slept on the base—Leyzaola fired a number of allegedly corrupt police officers, and was widely credited with restoring order. (He was also accused of human-rights abuses.) Citing the recent discovery in downtown Tijuana of two huge smuggling tunnels believed to belong to the Sinaloa cartel, David Shirk maintains that an accommodation by local crime bosses may also have been a factor. In any case, Plascencia told me, he has not heard of a businessperson being kidnapped in more than a year. He now moves freely across the border, sometimes two or three times in a day, without a bodyguard, but he still has customers at Romesco who are afraid to go home. “I have to be like a promoter, saying, ‘No, everything’s fine. Everything changed,’ ” he said. “And it’s the truth.”\n\n\n\nSince opening Misión 19, Plascencia has been renting an apartment in a secure high-rise building near Villa Saverios, the kind of place where returning Tijuanans are choosing to live rather than in houses, where they might feel more exposed. His children still live in Chula Vista, with Laura, but they are making plans to come back, as are other members of the family. One recent night at the original Giuseppi’s, Juan José, an elegant, soft-spoken man in a nice gray suit, was drinking a glass of wine with a friend, ending the evening the way restaurateurs everywhere do—only he had to drive home to a different country, through a militarized border checkpoint. “I want to come back to Tijuana,” he said. “My life is here.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nPlascencia’s effort to turn Tijuana into a culinary capital depends heavily on the work of the purveyor Pablo Ferrer, a former oceanographer with the posture of a dancer and a jewel thief’s pretty hands. Fifteen years ago, as a student of aquaculture in Ensenada, Ferrer started selling mussels to high-end restaurants in Mexico City. It disturbed him that most of the region’s seafood—including rare and costly items like abalone, urchins, and sea cucumbers—went to the Far East. The best vegetables went north. “I would go to the supermarket and have to choose the least spoiled tomatoes,” he told me. “And then I would go to the supermarket in San Diego and see huge, beautiful tomatoes stamped ‘Product of Mexico.’ ”\n\n\n\n\n\nFerrer became determined to create a local market for Baja’s produce. His first convert was an eccentric chef from Mexico City named Benito Molina—pastel wardrobe, Dadaist’s mustache—who had moved to Ensenada to cook at a winery. Molina made it a rule to use only Baja produce, at a time when his colleagues in Mexico City would tell customers that their Ensenada seafood came from New Zealand. (Now the lie is told in reverse.) “I was kind of crazy,” he told me. “I said, ‘We use what we have here—that’s it.’ I changed these guys’ mentality.” Molina’s cooking is experimental and inspired, and often fails to conform to diners’ expectations. At Manzanilla, the acclaimed restaurant in Ensenada that he owns with his wife, Solange Muris, he has been known to leave patrons waiting for hours, only to emerge from the kitchen with a dish of fish jelly topped with barnacles and seaweed. \n\n\n\nSometimes the region’s food movement is known as “Baja Med,” a term trademarked—and closely guarded—by Miguel Angel Guerrero, a native of Tijuana who, in spite of Spanish roots, styles himself as a modern-day Kumiai. He dives for the scallops, oysters, and chocolate clams that he serves in a vodka shot at his restaurant La Querencia, and shoots the hare for his hare carpaccio. Guerrero wears a camouflage chef’s coat, and serves his food as if to a hunting party around a campfire: in the skillet, or crudely massed. He let me know that Plascencia’s deliberate presentation is a little fussy for his taste. “Probably I’m more—how can you say?—_wild_,” he said. “More savage.” Loath to be outdone as a marketer, Juan José says that he recently trademarked “Mexiterranea.” “I don’t mind if somebody else uses it,” he told me, smiling. “That’s what we want, that Baja’s food becomes more known in the whole world.” \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoons\u002F593b60ffba20a654ac5d460e]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nPlascencia, helped by the prominence of his family’s restaurants, and the ambition of Misión 19, has become the figurehead of Baja cuisine, even in its place of origin. In August, he travelled to the Valle de Guadalupe, which is often described as a proto-Napa: forty wineries nestled in a hot-during-the-day, cool-at-night valley, with little rain and a morning marine layer from Ensenada Bay. The occasion was _las fiestas de la vendimia_, the harvest festival, which attracts tens of thousands of wealthy Mexican tourists. Phil Gregory, an Englishman who has a hotel and winery there, told me, “It’s a drinking festival to celebrate all the drinking we’ve done in the previous year and all the drinking we’re going to do in the coming year.” \n\n\n\nBut Plascencia wasn’t there to have fun. In the course of the festival, he catered twenty events, including a formal lunch for two thousand. At one of them, a three-hundred-person cookout, he arrived to find the kitchen tent a mess, with boxes full of serving dishes and foam coolers of oysters strewn about the floor. He took a few pictures with his phone and silently set to work moving them; the staff noticed and joined in. “I don’t like to yell at them too much while they’re working, because then they get more nervous and make more mistakes,” he said later. “I’ll get ’em Monday. I’ll show them the pictures and say, ‘Do you think this is well organized?’ ”\n\n\n\nOn the opening night of the festival, several thousand people assembled on the grounds of a former casino in Ensenada to eat and drink under the guard of military policemen with machine guns. Manzanilla had a booth staffed with two waiters and a tray of cold mini-tostadas; Molina, who wore pink pants and an Argyle sweater with a dribble of red wine down the front, was in a pavilion where the blackjack tables used to be, socializing. Guerrero didn’t even show up that night. “It’s too much,” he said, waving his hand dismissively when I asked him about it later. “I’m not Superman.”\n\n\n\nMisión 19’s booth—two long tables draped with floor-length black tablecloths, supporting a pair of towering flower arrangements—looked like an “Iron Chef” set. Behind the tables, Plascencia, wearing a black vest over a crisp white shirt, resolutely stirred a bubbling pot of arborio rice. He was serving his interpretation of rice and beans, which he accents with huitlacoche, black truffles, and epazote foam—only his foamer was broken, and one of the burners wouldn’t light. As he struggled to get it going, a long line of men in V-necked cashmere sweaters and women in form-fitting cocktail dresses peered into the pot. Every few seconds, someone asked him what he was cooking. “Risotto,” he replied tersely. Finally, he looked up. “_Tienes hambre_?” he said to the woman nearest him, as if he’d just remembered what he was there to do, then wiped his brow with a paper napkin. \n\n\n\nLeaving the event at midnight, Plascencia realized that he’d only eaten bread all day. He stopped at Manzanilla, an enchanting, unlikely place housed in an old shipyard, with hot-pink glass chandeliers hanging from the ceiling on green velvet ropes. Molina was there; he had changed into a white seersucker chef’s coat. Plascencia ordered a steak and watched coolly as his friends—cheesemakers, winemakers, restaurateurs—got loaded on gin cocktails. When he got to his car, at two-thirty, he removed a glass from its hood. “They’ll be going till five, six in the morning,” he said, around when he’d be getting up. \n\n\n\nThe next day, he was cooking lunch for twelve television executives from Mexico City, at a winery in the valley where a soap opera about the wine country—Mexico’s “Falcon Crest”—had recently been filmed. It was broiling hot. When he arrived, with his phone to his ear and a cutting board under his arm, Adria Montaño, the sous-chef from Misión 19—a slender twenty-five-year-old with rosebud lips and little burn marks up and down her arms—was under a white tent, braising lamb. She had been up all night, preparing. Plascencia hacked up some heirloom tomatoes and watermelon cucumbers as the television people arrived, in Panama hats and loafers with no socks. A little girl with a fashionable bob and fringed leather ankle boots led a tiny dog around on a leash. Montaño plated the tomatoes, adding a few tangles of arugula from a nearby farm and a creamy aged cow’s cheese. “_Tiene queso de Rancho Cortes_,” Plascencia told the lead waiter, a sleepy-eyed young man shaped like a bean bag. He turned to me and said, “It’s not just the clients I have to teach how to eat but also the waiters.” \n\n\n\nThe next course was chanterelle-and-lemon risotto, with Valle de Guadalupe quail and black truffles. “_Risotto Arborio con citricos y hongos chanterelles_,” Plascencia told the waiter. Then, “Tell me again what you’re serving.”\n\n\n\n“Mango?” the waiter said, uncertainly.\n\n\n\n“No, *HONGO*{: .small},” Plascencia said. \n\n\n\nThe owner of the vineyard came over with a glass of Chardonnay for Plascencia. He took a sip, and splashed some in a pan of shallots. When the lamb was done, he spooned a small portion onto each plate, and added the shallots, some squash, chickpea salsa, and a smattering of fingerling potato chips—an artful little heap. Plascencia whistled for the waiters, and paced. They lumbered back and forth to the table, ferrying lamb. “Taking their time,” he said. \n\n\n\nAfter the meal was over, the guests walked by, calling out compliments—“_Delicioso, de verdad!_” Adria dumped the leftover lamb onto two plates and covered them with a mound of salsa and chips. She did the same with the leftovers from dessert: granola and figs, and, then, as an afterthought, a couple of yellow fennel blossoms. That would be lunch for the waiters.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nWithout a tourist industry to pander to, an unself-conscious, sophisticated local culture has emerged in Tijuana—mescal bars, elegant cafés, experimental taco stands with twenty-five salsas—that is now being discovered by the food-adventurous. Bill Esparza, of Street Gourmet LA, has been bringing groups of high-profile eaters there since 2009. Andrew Zimmern, the host of “Bizarre Foods,” came down, and the May issue of _Food & Wine_ featured his recipe based on the chicken-neck tacos at Kentucky Fried Buches, in Tijuana’s red-light district. \n\n\n\n\n\nLast summer, I was invited to a dinner at a gallery on Tijuana’s industrial outskirts. The houses were small and pastel-colored, with “Beware of Dog” signs spray-painted on their exterior walls; a car alarm sounded endlessly. Many of the guests were from San Diego, and chatted nervously about being in Tijuana after dusk. During dinner—a multicourse meal, composed mostly of edible flowers and flecks of fish, cooked by a Valle de Guadalupe chef named Diego Hernandez—the American consul general gave a toast. “None of the Americans in the room tonight, who have come to Tijuana in the evening, none of you has been shot!” he said. \n\n\n\n“It’s early!” a Tijuanan replied.\n\n\n\nPlascencia is part of a group of restaurateurs who meet regularly and talk about crime and its effect on business. As the security situation began to improve, they noticed that although there was less anxiety—people had started eating out again at night, even wearing their watches—the streets were still dead. They invited the mayor to Villa Saverios for dinner, and then asked him to walk with them to Casa Plasencia for an after-dinner drink. It was a treacherous few blocks, along ill-lit, narrow sidewalks and pothole-ridden streets. The mayor got the point. He added streetlights and fixed the sidewalks, and the area, which has a half-dozen good restaurants, is now called the Zona Gastronómica. Plascencia would like to see it become a fully realized business and entertainment district, akin to the Gaslamp in downtown San Diego. However, the benches that were planned for have yet to be installed, and there is no sign to let the tourists—who might be tricked by the presence of a T.G.I.F. into thinking they were in regular old Tijuana—know where they are. Javier Gonzalez, who opened the city’s first cooking school, in 2003—now there are four—told me, “Javier’s been team leader. He’s always working, he’s always trying to join everyone.”  \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoons\u002F593b61021260cf20873e000b]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nIn October, Plascencia organized the first annual Baja California Culinary Fest: twenty-five events, including a hunting expedition with Guerrero, a Baja-ingredients cooking contest, and visits to cheese caves, mussel farms, and wineries. On the Friday of the festival, Esparza corralled fifty Los Angeles food connoisseurs—bloggers, Yelpers, and the members of two Meetup dining groups—and brought them on a bus to Tijuana for forty-eight hours of eating and drinking. He had stocked the bus with special tequila and told them to tweet about the ride under the hashtag #borrachageddon. Esparza held a bottle up and shook a couple shots’ worth into his mouth. The bloggers whooped as the bottle went around. (“You can’t get it in the U.S.,” my seatmate told me.) A big man with a hoarse voice and flushed cheeks passed a flask decorated with a picture of a slice of cherry pie and filled with something even more rarefied than the tequila. “This is sotol, from Chihuahua,” he said. “It’s like a wild mescal. The production is _kinda_ small.” \n\n\n\nMy seatmate took a long pull. “It’s, like, caramely, but butterscotchy,” he said, then passed out.\n\n\n\nAs the bus crossed the border into Mexico, Esparza said, “Welcome to Tijuana! Sex _y_ marijuana.”\n\n\n\nTurns out, tourists to Tijuana still want what they have always wanted—a taste of the forbidden, a touch of oblivion, free beer. Dinner that night was at Misión 19, ten courses prepared by Plascencia and three guest chefs. Arriving, the foodies stopped in little clusters before the sign, taking pictures for their blogs, then went upstairs to the rooftop bar for complimentary local microbrews. \n\n\n\nAfter dinner, the bloggers turned their attention to Plascencia, who the women had decided looked just like Javier Bardem. “He’s so damn cute!” one said. He held still while the ladies, misty with the exertion of eating for four hours straight, set upon him, taking picture after picture. (“Many of us have a crush on him,” a blogger told me later.) One of the foodies, who drank all the wine pairings and only picked at his meal, announced that he was going to go get laid.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nIn the spring of 2010, Javier’s brother Juan was walking past Caesar’s and noticed that the furniture was on the street: the current tenants were leaving. Juan José had been plotting for years to take it over, and he quickly made a deal with the landlords, a family that had owned the building since Cardini’s day. The Plascencias reopened Caesar’s that summer, at a time when half the storefronts on Revolución were shuttered. They built a kitchen in the space where the strip club had been, and hired an _ensaladero_ who had made the salad the old-fashioned way in his youth. \n\n\n\n\n\nRevolución is still a run-down, raucous place, lit by cheerful neon and populated by packs of loitering young men. But Caesar’s is a haven of civility. The walls are lined with photographs of old Tijuana and its leading families, including a picture of Martha’s mother, working at a perfume shop that used to be next door—a space that the Plascencias turned into a tapas bar. Excavating, they found old bottles of Miss Dior and Eau Arpège, which are displayed, still dusty, in glass cabinets. \n\n\n\nDuring the day, Caesar’s can be quiet; waiters sweep the black-and-white floor, and here and there a chubby tourist couple in shorts dutifully sip Bloody Marys while an impeccably dressed _ensaladero_ prepares the specialty of the house for them. Night transforms the place. The old families come and sit at long tables, talking and eating for hours, in mellow amber light from bistro chandeliers. “You see a lot of people walking around, staring at the pictures, saying, ‘I knew this guy!’ ” Javier says. Ella Gonzalez, a chic woman in her thirties, whose family has been in Tijuana for five generations, told me that, until the Plascencias took over the restaurant, she and her friends avoided it. “Caesar salad was made in Tijuana, but we never saw it,” she said. “Now we’re seeing it.”\n\n\n\nOn the last night of the Baja festival, Plascencia invited three Mexican chefs to cook with him at Caesar’s. In the kitchen, he wiped down a counter with a rag, and checked under the lid of a large steel pot cooking on a burner. He disappeared for a moment and returned with a small plate of haricots verts and snap peas, prodding them gently as he walked to his cutting board. A half-eaten green bean dangled from his lips like a droopy cigarette. \n\n\n\n“Some things I like to do myself,” he said, chopping the ends off the beans and sifting them through his fingers. From the pot he pulled a mass of cooked artichokes and cut them down to their hearts, then cut the hearts into small cubes. A few minutes later, he assembled his dish, a brilliant-green watercress soup, garnished with bits of artichoke, beans, and peas, and a sorbet of white grapes and Mexican lime, finished with a dash of avocado oil. He took a bite and licked his lips. It needed more acid.\n\n\n\nThe restaurant was full of Tijuanans, dressed up for a night out. The owner of the building was there with his wife and his daughter, a cooking-school student. A group of American expatriates occupied the center of the room; the women said they frequented Plascencia’s restaurants as part of their *RODEO*{: .small} Club: Retired Old Dames Eating Out. At a table by the door, Juan Tintos Funcke, the secretary of tourism for Baja, sat with his wife. He had told me earlier that he foresees a restaurant row on Revolución, with Caesar’s as the anchor, and shops selling authentic Baja art, not “leather jackets, T-shirts, and velvet paintings of Elvis.” Now he was just enjoying his dinner. “I love this place,” he said, as a waiter in a waistcoat delivered a porcelain boat full of Plascencia’s watercress soup, an asymmetrical arrangement with the jauntiness of a fascinator. “I brought the secretary general of tourism here and she was texting to President Calderón, ‘I’m in the place where Caesar salad originated!’ ” He took a polite slurp. “It’s a reason to come back to Revolution Avenue.” ♦","canonicalUrl":"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fmagazine\u002F2012\u002F01\u002F30\u002Fthe-missionary-dana-goodyear","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c9c7e716b454591add7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Border Security","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"border-security"},{"id":"5c2e1c972710c62d1081544c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"California","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"california"},{"id":"5c2e1c7d81ab3335f580f171","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"CHEFS","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"chefs"},{"id":"5c2e1f7d22d4972cd5b83524","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Cooks","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"cooks"},{"id":"5c2e1cb3ee7fe02cbd163384","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Crime","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"crime"},{"id":"5c2e1cb92bc86f2c9a244a00","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Criminals","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"criminals"},{"id":"5c2e1dbc2396212cbb9fcab5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Drug Cartels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"drug-cartels"},{"id":"5c2e1cba41c92e2c9b85da87","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Drug Dealers","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"drug-dealers"},{"id":"5c2e1c79ee7fe02cbd163329","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Food","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"food"},{"id":"5c2e1c842bfcc72cd92d0538","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Kidnapping","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"kidnapping"},{"id":"5c2e1dd181ab3335f580f2b0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mexican Food","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mexican-food"},{"id":"5c2e1c7b36cecf40192141d4","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mexico","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mexico"},{"id":"5c2e1fa5aef5062c9d94abaa","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Pizza","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"pizza"},{"id":"5c2e1c7c397f5b30646d05f2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Restaurants","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"restaurants"},{"id":"5c2e1ca741e4c73c088d77b4","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"San Diego","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"san-diego"}],"sections":[{"id":"591bb7e1349d4f46aa0522c1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Letter from Tijuana","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"letter-from-tijuana"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a187ac14b3c606c109f8a","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Dana Goodyear, a staff writer, was on the editorial staff of *The New Yorker* from 1999 to 2007, when she began writing full time for the magazine.

On the steep hillsides of the Santa Ana Volcano, in western El Salvador, she produces beans that trade on the extreme end of the coffee market, where a twelve-ounce bag may cost twenty dollars or more and comes accompanied by a lyrical essay on provenance and flavor. These beans have made Batlle an object of obsession among coffee connoisseurs and professionals—the coffee equivalent of a European vigneron—and she is willing to play the role, if it helps raise coffee’s status. Talking about coffee makes her happy; even her complaints are enthusiastic. “There are hundreds of Cabernets, and that’s O.K.,” she says. “Coffee should be the same way—they all taste different!” In a small but growing number of cafés, you can order coffee more or less the way you might order wine, specifying the varietal and the region and the farm; for the price of a glass of house red, you will receive, if you’re lucky, a cup of drip coffee that is mellower and weirder than the astringent beverage most people know. Perhaps you will detect a hint of gingerbread, or a honeyed aftertaste, or a rich, tangy sweetness that calls to mind tomato soup. And perhaps you will find it difficult to go back to whatever you used to drink.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the Salvadoran civil war, which lasted from 1980 until 1992, the Batlle family took refuge in Miami, which is where Aida Batlle grew up. After trying and forsaking college, she settled, with her husband, in Nashville, and sometime after her marriage fell apart she realized she had no good reason to stay there. She was twenty-eight, managing a restaurant and catering company, and she thought she might be more useful in El Salvador. Her father, Mauricio, was struggling: the price of coffee had reached a record low, and he was losing money with every harvest. \n\n\n\nShe arrived in Santa Ana, the country’s scruffy second city, in 2002, only vaguely acquainted with the business and practice of coffee farming. She knew that the family land had potential, because of its high altitude and rich volcanic soil. And although she had never actually drunk a cup of Batlle coffee, that wasn’t unusual—there was no such thing. Her father sold his crop to the local mill, which mixed it with crops from nearby farms and exported the product as a generic Salvadoran coffee blend. He gave his daughter control, assuming that, no matter what she did, the mill would still purchase whatever the farms produced. \n\n\n\nCoffee is a fruit—the beans are seeds that develop, in pairs, within the gumball-size cherry. Batlle’s idea was to treat her coffee the same way her local Wild Oats supermarket in Nashville had treated fruit: she would grow the plants organically and pick only cherry (coffee people never pluralize “cherry”) that was ripe and healthy-looking—the ones she would want to eat. (During harvest, she often snacks on coffee cherry, which has a mild, watermelonlike sweetness and some caffeine.) Because she was a novice, and a woman, she faced no small amount of skepticism from her farm managers—more than one worker responded to her requests by asking, “Where’s your father?” Eventually, they realized that her requests were directives: at one point, she threatened to fire a farm manager unless he agreed to send his kids to school. Batlle occasionally startled the cherry pickers by diving in alongside them to show them what she wanted done and, to a lesser extent, to help. She is an accurate picker, but not a quick one. Although Batlle didn’t quite realize it, her approach to coffee farming was deeply peculiar—she was coddling a crop that has, for centuries, been subjected to rough treatment. (Why worry about the succulence of the cherry if all you really care about is the pit?) But she arrived in El Salvador just as a new international coffee movement, drawn to beans and stories like hers, was cresting. \n\n\n\nFor much of the twentieth century, coffee was marketed under brand names that promised reliability: consumers knew that their next cup of Folgers—or, for that matter, their next cup of Starbucks—would taste just like last month’s, or last year’s. By the late nineteen-nineties, more roasters were deëmphasizing blended coffee in order to highlight the singular virtues of their favorite beans. In 1999, a cohort of coffee professionals created the Cup of Excellence, a series of national competitions designed to identify and reward exceptional farmers. Experts would conduct a blind coffee taste test, known as a cupping, and the winning beans would be sold through an online auction. El Salvador’s inaugural Cup of Excellence competition was held in 2003, and Batlle decided to enter. Coffee from Finca Kilimanjaro, one of her farms, impressed the panel of judges, which included Geoff Watts, of Intelligentsia Coffee, the influential Chicago-based roaster and café operator.\n\n\n\nCentral American coffees tend to taste rich and chocolaty. Kilimanjaro had some of the rich sweetness that judges expected, but it also had what professionals call “brightness”: a tart, fruity flavor more commonly associated with Kenyan coffee. Batlle was relieved to discover that she liked her own product, even though she didn’t know why. “I knew I was tasting something, but my brain could not identify it,” she says. Kilimanjaro won the competition, and at auction a Norwegian roaster paid $14.06 a pound for it, a record at the time. The open-market price was less than a dollar a pound. \n\n\n\nThe auction earned Batlle almost forty thousand dollars, which helped her convince her father that there were eager buyers for coddled coffee. More important, the publicity introduced Batlle to the coffee buyers she calls the “dream team”: Peter Giuliano, the scholarly co-owner of an idealistic North Carolina company called Counter Culture Coffee; Thompson Owen, the mad scientist behind Sweet Maria’s, in Oakland; and Duane Sorenson, the pugnacious founder of Stumptown, in Portland, Oregon. All of them understood Batlle’s conscientious farming—and they were willing to pay enough to allow her to keep at it. She had stumbled upon a community of people who cared almost as much about her farms as she did.  \n\n+++feature-small\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5909680c6552fa0be682f2db]|||\n\n A worker prunes a shade tree over the coffee plants on one of Batlle’s farms in El Salvador.\n\n|||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nOne warm morning this summer, Batlle drove up the side of the volcano in her off-road vehicle, a Toyota FJ Cruiser, to check on her farms. For most of the twentieth century, El Salvador was one of the biggest coffee producers in the world. But the Salvadoran coffee business still hasn’t recovered from the civil war, and today El Salvador exports less than half as much coffee as it did in 1975. In this diminished industry, Batlle is a visible symbol of rebirth, although the visibility comes at a cost. El Salvador is smaller than Massachusetts, with about as many people, and it has one of the world’s highest rates of violent crime. So Batlle travels with at least three companions: two armed guards and one extraordinarily well-trained German shepherd, Chief, who seems to be saving up all his barking for a sufficiently critical situation. On that morning, though, crime presented a less immediate danger than the washed-out dirt road. “Back when coffee ruled El Salvador, my great-grandfather used to be able to drive up here in a Buick,” Batlle said. She now requires not just her FJ Cruiser, with its row of four-wheel-drive controls (she calls them her “magic buttons”), but also a pair of black Harley-Davidson gloves so that she doesn’t get blisters from squeezing the steering wheel.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is possible to grow coffee near sea level, just not very good coffee. The rigors of elevation—lower oxygen levels, colder nights—force the plants to grow more slowly, creating harder, denser beans that produce the vibrant, slightly acidic flavors that are generally considered indispensable to a great cup. It was June, a month or two after harvest, and the farms bore few obvious signs of agricultural enterprise. Waist-high coffee plants with vinelike branches grew in no discernible pattern; they covered a hillside so sheer that pickers sometimes have to be lowered on ropes. (Batlle pays her pickers eight cents a pound, more than twice the going rate, because her exacting standards mean that everything takes longer.) Tall fruit trees, jocotes de corona and pepetos peludos, provide shade, which retards the ripening of the coffee cherry and intensifies the flavor of the beans; in some areas, sturdy copalchí trees form a wind curtain, letting breezes through but protecting the plants from damage. As Batlle’s truck arrived at a small farmhouse, the farm manager appeared: a lanky man in a camouflage Superman T-shirt, with two machetes hanging at his back.\n\n\n\nThe coffee plant is native to the part of Africa that is now Ethiopia. By the fifteenth century, traders and thieves were planting it farther afield. It spread through the Arab world to India, to Southeast Asia, and, largely through a French colonial officer in the early seventeen-hundreds, to the Caribbean and the Americas. In El Salvador the small farmers, much romanticized by coffee fanatics, are often small landlords, some of whom don’t have much interest in agronomy. But Batlle’s managers have grown accustomed to her daily visits and detailed questions. Perhaps she didn’t seem intimidating at first: she is a small, friendly woman who wears jeans and a T-shirt whenever possible, and she has a shy smile, although her shyness dissolves whenever talk turns to coffee, as it always does, often at her instigation. She hates public speaking, but she excels at chatting up strangers, many of whom find themselves peering at photographs of coffee plants on her iPhone.\n\n\n\nBatlle’s farms are dominated by a temperamental but fertile cultivar called bourbon (pronounced “bour-*BONE*{: .small}”), a member of the arabica species named for the Indian Ocean island of Réunion, formerly known as Bourbon, where it thrived. Bourbon came to El Salvador more than a hundred years ago, acquired from Guatemala by the governor of Santa Ana Province, Narciso Avilés, Batlle’s great-great-grandfather. She waded into a copse where spindly bourbon plants grew alongside a newer hybrid, pacamara. Batlle’s heterogeneous inventory is partly a result of El Salvador’s complicated history: civil war interrupted the national coffee industry at a time when other Central American countries were replacing their bourbon plants with hardier hybrids; as a result, in El Salvador more of the old varieties survived. “To me, these bourbons have always been ballerinas—tall, elegant,” Batlle said, fondly. “These pacas are more like gymnasts—short and stumpy.” As she left one farm, she called the manager over and pointed to some bourbon shoots. “Treat them with love and kindness, please,” she said.\n\n\n\nIn order to have her coffee certified organic, Batlle must pay for annual inspections, which often lead to further expenditures. One year, the inspector noticed that a neighbor had cows, and Batlle had to erect fences to keep the nonorganic cows (and their nonorganic dung) away from her plants. Because she can’t use chemical herbicides, she is always looking for organic alternatives. “I tried the natural one, made from clove oil and cinnamon oil—it’s called Weed Zap,” she said, shaking her head. “Nothing. The weeds were like, ‘Hey, thanks for this!’ ” At Finca Kilimanjaro, where workers were digging small holes to replant one slope with juvenile bourbon plants, she spied a white speck in the dirt, picked it up, and summoned an overseer. “_La gallina ciega_,” she said—she was holding in her palm a tiny beetle larva, curled up into a ball. “They eat the roots,” she said. “They’re horrible.” Coffee plants also manufacture their own pesticide: a chemical that is toxic to some small organisms and mildly intoxicating to larger ones. For many coffee drinkers, that chemical—caffeine—is all that matters. The beverage, in its humblest incarnation, is little more than a pesticide delivery system. \n\n\n\nAs Batlle drove higher up the hill, blasting Eminem, the climate shifted. At fifty-three hundred feet, which is about as high as coffee will flourish, the air was cool, and leafy bushes had given way to spindly cypress trees. The truck came to a stop on a neat lawn next to a house that looked out over the valley to Santa Ana and beyond. This was Los Alpes, the family’s highest-altitude farm. Next to the main house was a rectangular patch surrounded by the remains of concrete walls. It had been one of the family houses, and it was burned down during the civil war. Batlle experienced the violence of the eighties only indirectly, through the brutal and surreal things she saw during her occasional visits to El Salvador. “It sounds bad,” she said, “but you get used to seeing dead bodies by the side of the road.”\n\n\n\nBatlle has been back in El Salvador for almost a decade, but she lives like an expatriate—when she talks about home, she often means Miami. In Santa Ana she doesn’t drink the water, and she keeps her distance from the roadside venders selling pupusas and corn on the cob. She almost never goes to San Salvador, except for meetings or flights. “I do need to have more of a personal life,” she says. “But my problem is I don’t miss it.” Her passions include the rapper Flo Rida and the video game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, which she plays online, using a screen name one of her nephews came up with: coffeerockstar.\n\n\n\nAs she toured her farms, Batlle was distracted by a series of e-mails and phone calls. Her father had died a few weeks before; Mauricio Batlle had been seventy-two. There were lawyers and documents that needed Batlle’s attention, and decisions that only she could make. She had learned her father’s business just in time to succeed him. Back in town, inside a family compound ringed by a fifteen-foot-high wall, Batlle showed off the small office that she had shared with him. The room was dominated by his desk, and was full of mementos, including a hand-drawn map of the family farms from 1938. On a small table in one corner, there were nearly fifty bags of her coffee, from roasters around the world, most accompanied by testimonials. From a 2008 Stumptown offering: “Aida Battle’s relentless focus on picking perfectly ripe cherry during the harvest and her flawless processing . . . are virtually unmatched and evident in the cup.” When she first saw that blurb, she dispatched a friendly e-mail to Stumptown, both to say thanks and to point out politely that someone had misspelled her last name. \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoon\u002F593b60f3ba20a654ac5d4602]||||||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nMost coffee farmers don’t fact-check their clients’ promotional material, but these clients are Batlle’s peers and her closest friends. Her success has to do with culture as well as agriculture: she speaks unaccented English, she isn’t intimidated by coffee connoisseurs, and she understands foodie culture in the global North. Plenty of farmers have great land and great cherry, but almost none of them share Batlle’s keen understanding of what her customers want to drink, what they want to hear, and what they’re willing to pay. \n\n\n\nThe commodity-market price of coffee, known as the C, hit a modern-era low of around forty cents a pound in late 2001, just before Batlle arrived in Santa Ana. When she got there, she encountered a slew of programs designed to help producer countries capture more of coffee’s value, including the Cup of Excellence competition. During the down market, nonprofits and coöperatives often made common cause with importers and roasters, all of whom wanted to keep coffee farming viable. A patchwork of certifications, such as Fair Trade and Rainforest Alliance, assured farmers higher prices in exchange for specific economic or environmental practices. (Coffee inspires people to think about it while they sip, which explains why the demand for ethically farmed coffee is much higher than, say, the demand for ethically farmed sugar or bananas.) At first, Batlle could afford to ignore the fluctuations of the C, because her crop was worth so much more. At boutique cafés, there was no incentive to lower prices—customers liked the idea of paying a premium for a premium cup, especially if the cup came with a story about a plucky farmer’s daughter and her organic experiments. \n\n\n\nIn the past decade, though, the C has climbed steadily upward, which has complicated the lives of high-end farmers and their clients. Roasters were forced to figure out whether to raise their prices, lower their standards, or swallow the difference. To buy her newest farm, Finca Tanzania, Batlle had secured a line of credit on the basis of a purchase order from Stumptown, which contracted to buy her Finca Tanzania crop for two dollars and fifty cents a pound—more than a dollar over the C. By harvesttime, earlier this year, the C was heading toward three dollars, the highest price in decades, and Batlle found herself prepared to sell some of the world’s most coveted coffee for less than the price of a generic lot. (In the end, Stumptown willingly paid more.) \n\n\n\nSome relationships aren’t so friendly, and roasters who refuse to adjust their contracts in rising markets might find themselves confronted by shortfalls come harvesttime. (“Now, that’s technically in breach of contract,” one buyer explains. “But try suing five hundred Mexican farmers for coffee.”) The rising C has also made coffee more valuable to thieves. One day this spring, armed pickers arrived at Finca Kilimanjaro: they held the farm manager at gunpoint while they cleaned out the plants. “Kilimanjaro had the highest yield this year,” Batlle says. “But it turned out to be the lowest, because we had two days of non-stop theft. It was awful!” No doubt her beans were blended and sold as generic high-elevation coffee. To Batlle, the thought of this adulteration is more painful than the theft.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nExpert coffee pickers don’t pluck cherry; they spin it, separating the fruit from the stem by rotating it between the thumb and the first finger, which enables them to strip a branch quickly. In Ethiopia, farmers customarily left their cherry out in the sun, where the dry heat evaporated the moisture from the pulp, making it easy to detach seed from skin. As coffee was introduced to more humid climates, this method, known as the dry, or natural, method, became somewhat unreliable: cherry that didn’t dry properly might mold or rot. Now most high-quality coffee is processed using the wet, or washed, method, in which cherry is skinned and pulped, put in fermentation tanks to soften the mucilage, and moved to washing tanks, where the mucilage is sloughed off; only then are the beans set out in the sun to dry. In El Salvador, coffee farmers take their cherry to the local mill, which does all the processing, finds a buyer, and ships the unroasted beans, known as green coffee, to its clients around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nBatlle’s local mill is J. Hill, which was founded in 1896 by James Hill, a British-born coffee dealer. The company has maintained its founder’s original house, next to the main factory. The bedroom balcony, which overlooks the drying patios, is equipped, rather ominously, with an antiquated spotlight and loudspeaker. Batlle’s beans represent less than one per cent of what J. Hill processes, but she often visits the mill, where she monitors everything from the health of her beans to the screen-printing of the jute bags they are shipped in. For Batlle, the mill is also a laboratory, where she can experiment with methods from around the world. Her favorite place in the compound is the cupping room, where she can roast small samples of her coffee and judge the results. El Salvador, like many coffee-producing countries, has never really developed a coffee-drinking culture, so J. Hill’s cupping room is the closest thing in the area to a well-equipped café. The espresso machine is a stainless-steel GS\u002F3, made by the Florence-based company La Marzocco; its suggested retail price is sixty-five hundred dollars.\n\n\n\nBatlle’s most trusted lieutenant, Douglas Chinchilla, had run some recently roasted samples through a retail-grade Mahlkönig grinder, and he was apportioning the grounds into small white cups, adding precisely twelve and a half grams to each. The cups were arranged around the perimeter of a circular white table that turned on a stem. Batlle spun the table, picking up each cup of dry coffee and pressing it to her face to inhale the nutty fragrance. When she was finished, Chinchilla added two hundred and fifty millilitres of hot water to each cup, and he gave the coffee four minutes to steep. When coffee and hot water combine, undisturbed, most of the grounds sink to the bottom, and a layer of foam and fine particles, known as the crust, forms on top. Batlle used her cupping spoon to break each crust; by disturbing the top layer, she released a small, scented burst, which she inhaled. Then, with a spoon in each hand, she skimmed off the crust and prepared to cup.\n\n\n\nTo cup a coffee, you slurp a spoonful, as quickly and loudly as possible—the idea is to spray coffee at all your taste buds simultaneously. Batlle slurped for a few seconds, expelled the specimen into her spit cup, rotated the table a few degrees, and began the process again. Coffee cupping was formalized in San Francisco, in the late nineteenth century, by dealers who wanted a standard way to assess and certify their product. They were looking for defects: a peanutty taste indicated the presence of beans from unripe cherry, known as quakers; a foul, fetid taste meant that the beans had been attacked by the tenacious borer beetle. At the high end of the coffee market, though, cuppers search for pleasant tastes instead. “Kilimanjaro has always been described as a fruit cup,” Batlle said. “Like fruit in heavy syrup.” One of the coffees on the cupping table was a new experiment: beans from Finca Kilimanjaro, processed in the Ethiopian natural style, to create a more pungent flavor. She slurped and spit. There was an earthy sweetness, fading to reveal something brighter and juicier. “I’m getting chocolate-covered cherries,” she said.  \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoon\u002F593b60f520855957e69d55a9]||||||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nEveryday coffee drinkers, like everyday wine drinkers, often suspect that the experts are bluffing, or free-associating. The industry is sensitive to this aspersion, and takes pains to dispel it: at the Cup of Excellence, judges must be able to describe samples the same way when they are presented at different tables, in different orders. For a novice, the cupping room can be a disorienting place. You slurp and spit, ingesting small but palpable doses of caffeine, trying to taste chocolate-covered cherries. Before long, you might start to suspect that the coffee is cupping you—with each clumsy slurp and tentative adjective, you are revealing your defects.\n\n\n\nAfter watching the experts grade her coffee at the Cup of Excellence in 2003, Batlle resolved to teach herself how to taste. Within a week of non-stop cupping, she was able to identify coffee’s basic flavors. The skills required—sustained concentration, precise sensory awareness, decisiveness—came naturally to her. “Sometimes I think about that,” she says. “Like, what if, when I first started cupping, I sucked at it?” Her mastery meant that she could talk to clients about the beverage, not just the plants. In an industry where farmers and connoisseurs have often been kept apart, Batlle is both—she’s a producer who speaks fluent consumer. Last year, she became the first coffee farmer to earn a certification from the Barista Guild of America.\n\n\n\nAfter a few rounds in the J. Hill cupping laboratory, Batlle agreed to go to the nearby branch of a Salvadoran chain called the Coffee Cup, which has about two dozen cafés. A display near the counter was inscribed with coffee-shop boilerplate, in English: “After the roasting process, we sort our roasted coffee beans by hand—meticulously—to pick out only the highest quality beans.” Batlle peered at a photograph of some unroasted coffee beans. “They look like they have too much humidity,” she said. “They weren’t dried properly.” She turned to a photograph of roasted beans and pointed to a few light-brown beans among the dark ones: “See? Quakers!” When her cup of americano finally arrived, it didn’t disappoint—which is to say, it did. She slurped, and swiftly wished she hadn’t. “You burned me,” she said. “When the top of your tongue goes numb, that’s burning your taste buds. Luckily, I’m not cupping today. Or tomorrow.” Scalding coffee is the bane of cuppers, who prefer their coffee warm, not hot, because the best coffees get sweeter and more complex as they approach room temperature. Nevertheless, Batlle managed to supply some tasting notes. “One thing I did get was a papery taste,” she said. “That could be from last year’s crop. Or it could be coffee that wasn’t stored properly.” To someone who’s really paying attention, coffee is a form of communication—each cup, even a bad one, tells the story of how it got that way.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nWhen Batlle’s coffee is ready to be shipped, she sometimes packs it herself, and when the last of it has been sent off to the U.S. or Norway or Japan she follows it. Her trips north are both social visits and investigative missions. She says, “If I ever went, and they were roasting the shit out of—or blending, God forbid!—my coffee, then it’s over.” Steve Kirbach, a roaster at Stumptown, remembers being introduced to Batlle some years ago at a Stumptown café in Portland. He had been roasting for only a few months, and apparently he had let a batch of Finca Kilimanjaro go too long—roasters measure their recipes in seconds, not minutes. Batlle had examined the beans, then smiled at him and said, “Oh, you feel comfortable with this roast?” Kirbach, who is now one of Stumptown’s head roasters, remembers feeling humbled and guilty. “How many days did Aida work on this product? And then I had it for, what, fourteen minutes?”\n\n\n\n\n\nKirbach got a chance to redeem himself one day this summer, when Batlle visited Stumptown’s New York roasting facility, a cramped warehouse in Red Hook, Brooklyn. A shipment of Kilimanjaro had just arrived. He dropped twenty pounds of it into a nineteen-fifties-era drum roaster, which spun the beans and then dumped them into a cooling bed. Kirbach was concerned with temperature and momentum (the speed at which the beans were heating up), and with all the things he couldn’t control, like the weather, which was hot and humid. He tried not to be too distracted by the presence, a few feet away, of an extremely interested party.\n\n\n\nA drum roaster comes equipped with a tryer, a cylindrical wooden-handled scoop that slots through a circular hole in the door; a roaster is constantly removing the tryer and inspecting the beans in it. Around four minutes later, the beans reached three hundred degrees, and they started to swell. “You can tell it’s an organic material,” Kirbach said. “There’s, like, a fat there.” At six and a half minutes, the beans were getting brown, and there was a hint of the nutty aroma that would soon emerge. “There’s something super special about that smell,” Kirbach said. “A lot of people describe it as popcorn, but I can almost smell, like, sweet pea.” He handed the tryer to Batlle, who inhaled and then beamed proudly. At thirteen and a half minutes, Kirbach opened the roaster door, and the beans spilled out into a circular cooling bed, raked by spinning radial arms. When the coffee cooled down, he scooped up a handful of beans and dropped them into a grinder, which spewed grounds into a shot glass. Batlle inhaled, and her eyes got bright. “Wow,” she said.\n\n\n\nKirbach inhaled. “There’s a molasseslike note,” he said. “But at the same time you can also pick out honey—almost like a chestnut honey.”\n\n\n\nBatlle nodded. “Like the top of the crème brûlée, when they burn off the sugar,” she said.\n\n\n\nNext door, in the cupping lab, Aleco Chigounis, Stumptown’s coffee buyer, had set up six unlabelled stations, with Kilimanjaro and coffee from five other farms. He asked Batlle which one she preferred. She sniffed, broke crusts, sniffed again, scooped, slurped, and spit. “No. 1 is my favorite,” she said, firmly. “Because that’s the Kilimanjaro.”\n\n\n\nChigounis looked at her. “No, it’s not.”\n\n\n\nBatlle looked back. “Yes, it is.”\n\n\n\nChigounis sighed. “O.K., you’re right,” he said. “You’re good!”\n\n\n\nBatlle seemed wounded. She said, “You don’t think I know my own coffee?”\n\n\n\nStumptown came to New York two years ago and quickly found a market. Cafés bragged about brewing Stumptown beans, and locals proved willing to rearrange their commutes to accommodate Stumptown’s Manhattan café, which is inside the Ace Hotel, on West Twenty-ninth Street. Stumptown, with its Red Hook roasting facility, is one of a handful of small Brooklyn roasters. Café Grumpy, a home-grown outfit, has been roasting in Greenpoint since 2005, and Blue Bottle, from Oakland, arrived in Williamsburg last year. \n\n\n\nThis flurry of activity marks the revival, on a smaller scale, of an old New York tradition. America became a nation of coffee drinkers in the eighteen-hundreds, and, after the Civil War, New York replaced New Orleans as the main entry point for coffee shipments. In 1881, the coffee mogul John Arbuckle built a coffee warehouse on the Brooklyn waterfront, in what is now Dumbo. The Maxwell House company, Arbuckle’s great rival, built a grand Brooklyn factory in 1921 and, soon after, an even grander one in Hoboken.  \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoon\u002F593b60f720855957e69d55ad]||||||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nThe rise of Maxwell House was a triumph of advertising: like most successful coffee companies, it promoted itself with vague assertions of excellence. The coffee historian Mark Pendergrast views Maxwell House as an early example of the value of “snob appeal,” and one 1907 advertisement had a distinctly challenging tone: “*EVERY HOUSEWIFE*{: .small} who has a knowledge of coffee value will appreciate the rare quality of Maxwell House Blend.” Before the rise of national roasters like Maxwell House, consumers typically roasted (or ruined) the beans themselves or bought from local grocers; like many other twentieth-century food conglomerates, the big coffee companies convinced consumers to trade freshness for consistency and convenience. \n\n\n\nBrewing habits were changing, too: instead of boiling the grounds along with the water (a common nineteenth-century practice), coffee drinkers wanted easier methods and better-tasting coffee, although then, as now, these two wants often conflicted. The percolator, a turn-of-the-century invention, pushed boiling water up a stem into a separate chamber full of grounds; the mixture would steep, and coffee would drip back down into the main chamber, where it would mix back into the boiling water. The device’s main asset was also its main liability: you could turn it on and forget about it, pushing increasingly bitter and burnt liquid through an increasingly bleached bed of grounds, creating an infinitely bad cup of coffee. By the nineteen-seventies, the endless-loop percolator had been displaced by the electric drip coffeemaker, which was a vast improvement (because water passed through the grounds only once) but in many ways a crude technology, because it offered users no way to control water temperature or steep time. \n\n\n\nIn 1946, Americans went through forty-six gallons of coffee per person—a record, and one that has never been broken. The cola industry convinced children and their parents that caffeine could be fizzy and fun, and it made coffee seem like an old folks’ drink. The coffee industry’s response was to fight its playful rival by embracing seriousness. In 1952, the Pan-American Coffee Bureau popularized the phrases “coffee break” and “coffee stop,” encouraging workers and drivers to build coffee into their routines; according to Pendergrast, this campaign spread to hospitals, churches, political events, and schools. A social ritual turned into an institutional one, and, just as important, a recreational drug was rebranded as a functional drug—something to get you going and keep you going, not something to love. The U.S. coffee market has been shrinking ever since: Americans now drink about half as much coffee per person as they did fifty years ago, and soda consumption passed coffee consumption in 1977. \n\n\n\nIt’s not hard to see why a generation of frustrated American coffee lovers grew up idolizing European coffee culture. Europe had coffeehouses, which had long been linked (sometimes erroneously) to intelligent thought; Europe had musky dark roasts; and Europe had espresso, a turn-of-the-century Italian invention, created by forcing water through finely ground coffee at high pressure. The European-style coffeehouses that emerged in cities like New York served intense, unusual coffee to intense, unusual people, some of whom found they liked the beverage even more than they liked the scene. In 1966, a second-generation coffee roaster from Holland, Alfred Peet, opened Peet’s Coffee & Tea, Inc., in North Berkeley, which might have been the first evangelical café in America, aiming not just to serve its customers but also to enlighten them. Peet, who died in 2007, viewed typical American coffee as not merely bad but wrong: overbrewed and underroasted. Guided by his edicts, locals could learn to drink a richer, more alkaline form of coffee. Among his fans were three young men in Seattle who bought Peet’s beans for the coffee shop they opened there in 1971, called Starbucks.\n\nHoward Schultz came to Starbucks in 1982, when it had five locations. It didn’t much resemble a budding fast-food empire, and Schultz didn’t much resemble a coffee person. He was an executive at a Swedish kitchenware company in New York. He had noticed that Starbucks, an account in Seattle, was ordering an unusually large number of coffee-filter cones. When he travelled to Starbucks to investigate, he ordered a simple black coffee made with Sumatran beans and had a revelation: “The coffee I had been drinking was swill.” After a year of negotiation, he was hired as the director of marketing, and in 1983, during a business trip to Italy, he tried latte for the first time. In his memoir “Pour Your Heart Into It,” Schultz eulogized the moment:   \n\n\n\u003E Here was the perfect balance between steamed milk and coffee, combining espresso, which is the noble essence of coffee, and milk made sweet by steaming rather than by adding sugar. It was the perfect drink. Of all the coffee experts I had met, none had ever mentioned this drink. \n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n“Coffee experts” are often purists, which may explain why none of them had ever encouraged Schultz to drown his espresso in steamed milk. Schultz’s conflicting impulses—his love of coffee’s “noble essence” and his eagerness to improve upon it—became the blueprint for Starbucks, which has always portrayed itself as a company built on unadulterated coffee enthusiasm while cannily recognizing that few of its customers actually want unadulterated coffee. (The Frappuccino is essentially a milkshake, except that people aren’t ashamed to have one at breakfast.) Even so, by turning the latte into a fast-food staple, Starbucks encouraged an astonishingly wide range of consumers to think of themselves as coffee people, and, more specifically, espresso people. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe farmer-obsessed coffee movement that has arisen over the past decade is sometimes called the “third wave,” to distinguish it from the European-inspired, espresso-oriented second wave, which produced Starbucks. (In this model, the first wave would be the enthusiasm of a century ago, which created national brands like Maxwell House.) “Third wave” is an imprecise term, and in some ways a misleading one, since it reduces hundreds of years of coffee history to a few decades of American whims. When Peter Giuliano, of Counter Culture, lectures on coffee, he likes to show a slide of a woman in Ethiopia squatting on a dirt floor, boiling coffee over a fire. “This is what coffee has been for thousands of years,” he says, to remind audiences that even the most bare-bones, old-fashioned modern coffee preparation is, in some sense, a perversion.\n\n\n\nThe architects of coffee’s third wave credit Starbucks with helping build what’s known as the specialty-coffee industry, but few of them have any kind words for Starbucks’ standard, dark-roasted-coffee offerings, which have a distinctive, charcoaled flavor that is detectable even in Via, the company’s instant coffee. Schultz argues that dark roasting is a way to celebrate exceptional beans. “The darker the beans are roasted the fuller the flavor,” he says. His successors in the third wave are more likely to view dark roasting as a way to burn off all the personality that makes coffee interesting, and they blame Starbucks for convincing consumers that darker is better. One buyer for a Starbucks competitor sighed when asked about French roast, the darkest variety. “It’s probably my least-favorite roast, but it’s our biggest seller,” he said. \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoon\u002F593b60f90f529324ac062bfe]||||||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nStumptown, which opened its first café in 1999, has pushed hard against the Europhilic approach. Customers can order espresso-based drinks, but the shops’ crowded blackboards are dominated by lists of farms and regions. The idea is to emphasize terroir over technique, and to deëmphasize fancy Italian drinks and secret house blends. At Intelligentsia Coffee’s shop in Venice, California, customers line up (there is always a line) in an open-air foyer, and when they get to the front there is a menu—anyone who wants a drip coffee must choose from the day’s list of featured beans. Then you pay, sometimes six or seven dollars, and then you wait, while a barista grinds the beans, tips them into a cone, and spends a few minutes drizzling water over them. The cafés of the nineties taught consumers that serious coffee drinkers drank espresso. Now the most influential cafés take pains to prove that humble drip coffee can be just as serious. Espresso is almost always blended, because a coffee’s quirks can be unpleasant in concentrated form. But drip coffee is an ideal showcase for idiosyncratic beans; Counter Culture recently offered a coffee from Sidama, Ethiopia, that transmitted the spicy, floral taste of bergamot oil. \n\n\n\nIn coffee, a shift in fashion is often linked to a shift in values: where once espresso epitomized an industry eager to sell luxury, now drip coffee epitomizes an industry eager to sell transparency. Earlier this year, Schultz published another memoir, “Onward.” In keeping with the current mood, he casts himself as a champion of coffee purism. He retells the story of his magical trip to Italy, and talks about the country’s seductive espresso-bar culture. But one drink is conspicuous by its absence from the story: latte.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nBrewing a proper cup of coffee is a lot harder than uncorking a bottle of wine and a lot easier than cooking dinner. There are only two ingredients, which must be combined and then separated, but somehow these variables can produce an almost limitless number of errors and misjudgments, any one of which can smother the flavors.\n\n\n\n\n\nBatlle has little patience for discussions about any apparatus more exotic than a press pot, also known as a French press, which is what she used when she was living in Nashville and still uses today. The design is nearly a hundred years old, and it has barely changed: coffee mixes with water in a large beaker, and then a metal mesh plunger is brought down, sequestering the grounds at the bottom. The resulting cup is rich, though perhaps slightly muddy, because fine particles can slip through the plunger. But an accomplished cupper like Batlle need not obsess over brewing methods, because she knows what she’s doing, and what she’s tasting, regardless of muddiness. An obsession with brewing protocol is generally the mark of an amateur—that pitiable person who makes a simple thing complicated in the futile hope of feeling kinship with the professionals. Nevertheless, if you are making coffee you might as well make it well.\n\n\n\nFor many home brewers, the problem starts in the refrigerator, or even the freezer, which is where a lot of Americans store their coffee. The idea is to keep the grounds from going stale or rancid, but refrigerators and freezers are full of odors that can wind up in the cup. The best way to drink fresh coffee is to buy whole beans and keep them in the cupboard; brew them a few minutes after grinding them, and no more than a few weeks after they were roasted. (Trustworthy roasters specify the roast date of every batch.) A spinning-blade grinder, which is what most people use, is much better than nothing, although a blade grinder isn’t actually a grinder: it’s a chopper, slicing arbitrarily through the beans, producing a riot of coffee fragments, from shards to dust. It’s impossible to get an even brew from uneven grounds, and once you have detected the acrid notes in partially overextracted coffee it is not easy to un-detect them. So if you are inclined to spend money on coffee equipment, spend it on a burr mill, which works like a pepper grinder, crushing beans instead of slicing them. (A hand-crank burr mill costs about fifty dollars, and electric versions start at under a hundred.)\n\n\n\nBeyond that, home brewing gets more complicated, even, or especially, for anyone who just wants to make great drip coffee. A digital scale might seem like overkill, but weighing the beans and the water is one of the easiest ways to improve your coffee, and one of the cheapest. (Look for one with a capacity of at least a kilogram; there is no need to pay more than twenty dollars.) The other accessory you’ll need is a ceramic cone, with a small hole, and some paper filters. Boil water. Grind eighteen to twenty-two grams of beans. Fit the filter into the cone and flush it with boiling water—this helps prevent your coffee from tasting like wet paper. Put the mug onto the scale, put the cone on the mug, and put the ground coffee in the cone. Pour forty grams of water over the grounds and watch them bloom: if the coffee is fresh, it should swell and release small bubbles of carbon dioxide. After about forty-five seconds, start pouring the rest of the water, beginning in the middle of the grounds and circling outward. Pour slowly and pause often: the grounds should never drain dry, but the water level should remain low. Pour three hundred and twenty-five grams of water, including the initial forty, and remove the cone once the trickle has become a slow drip. The process should take about four minutes.\n\n\n\nThe steps are simple, yet there are countless ways to err—and to improve upon any recipe, including this one. Done properly, a pour-over should produce a cup that is rich but also slightly tangy, and complex enough to make the ostentatious tasting notes on the bag seem plausible, if not quite persuasive. Asked whether the subtle virtues of Finca Kilimanjaro were lost on most casual drinkers, Batlle shook her head. “I think anybody can taste the difference, if they’re drinking it black.” \n\n\n\nOf course, most people don’t drink their coffee black, and they have no desire to start. (The gentlest, most savory, hand-brewed cup might nevertheless repel someone who has come to associate coffee with creamy sweetness.) The tradition of coffee evangelism, epitomized by Alfred Peet, can seem, in its clumsier expressions, capricious, or even pernicious: a small cabal of self-appointed experts, telling everyone else that they are doing it wrong. Even Starbucks, with its nearly eleven thousand American outlets, is widely perceived as an élite taste, an upscale alternative to the local corner store or fast-food chain, or the can of Folgers at home. Dunkin’ Donuts has targeted non-Starbucks customers with a slogan that evokes the utilitarian ethos of the nineteen-fifties, when the company was founded: “America runs on Dunkin’.” And, far from the world of ceramic cones and digital scales, the most consequential recent development in home brewing is the increasing popularity of the Keurig coffee brewer, a fuss-free machine that brews consistent—but rather drab—individual cups from pods full of preground coffee.\n\n\n\nCoffee evangelists believe that coffee deserves to be treated like wine, which has fairly well-established taste hierarchies that are supposed to correspond, however inexactly, to price hierarchies: plenty of people drink cheap wine, although a great many of them would probably switch to more expensive wine if money were no object. But what if coffee turns out to be more like beer? There is less variation in beer prices, and more brand loyalty at the low end of the market: people who drink Budweiser truly love Budweiser, and most of them have no interest in switching to a Goose Island ale or a Russian River lager, no matter the price. Microbrewers thrive, but that doesn’t mean that Budweiser drinkers are an endangered species, and only the most pigheaded snob could fail to see the appeal of a cold, watery macrobrew on a hot afternoon. \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoon\u002F593b60faba20a654ac5d4606]||||||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nBatlle resists snobbery, as any good evangelist must: she thinks that coffee salvation should be available to anyone who seeks it. But the coffee community she loves, where everyone knows everyone, wouldn’t exist if the number of converts weren’t so small. In order for connoisseurs to exist, they must be outnumbered by philistines, and if the connoisseurs are honest they will admit that they enjoy this state of affairs. The citric flavor of a Kenyan coffee might seem unpleasantly sour to a novice, and so loving Kenyan coffee is a way to show you are not a novice. \n\n\n\nThere will probably always be a market for small roasters who can manage to stay one step ahead of the big brands, no matter what the big brands are doing. A few years ago, Stumptown and other ambitious cafés embraced an automated single-cup system called the Clover, which leaches coffee out of ground beans using vacuum pressure created by the slow pumping of a metal piston. Its strikingly smooth operation, which seemed vaguely sinister, earned the Clover a measure of YouTube celebrity, and its price—about eleven thousand dollars—made it famous. Among the shops that bought one was Café Grumpy in Chelsea, which is where Howard Schultz spotted it: he declared that it produced the best coffee he’d ever had, and in 2008 he arranged for Starbucks to buy the company that made it. The reaction came quickly: Stumptown, the first adopter, announced that it would sell all five of its Clovers and revert to press pots. The Clover backlash also bolstered the move, in many leading cafés, toward cheap but finicky methods like the slow-motion pour-over. Not coincidentally, these methods are more resistant to corporate encroachment—it’s hard to turn slow coffee into fast food.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nEarlier this year, Stumptown accepted an investment from TSG Consumer Partners, the company that made VitaminWater a hit. Around the time the deal was announced, Stumptown rolled out a new product: cold-brewed iced coffee, served in a ten-and-a-half-ounce glass bottle called a stubby, based on an old beer-bottle design. Even with new money and a new product, the company operates on a much smaller scale than Starbucks, which has been bottling Frappuccino, in partnership with PepsiCo, since 1996. It’s hard to imagine artisanal coffee going mass-market. But then, not long ago, the triumph of Starbucks—which taught Americans the meaning of “latte” and popularized dark-roasted coffee, while also requiring its customers to speak Italian—would have been pretty hard to imagine, too.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a small farmer like Batlle, the question of expansion is even more fraught: with the acquisition of Finca Tanzania, she can produce about thirty tons of coffee if the weather coöperates and the thieves stay away. She is experimenting with increasingly adventurous picking techniques (this year, she sorted some cherry by color, to emphasize micro-variations within her farms), and she is building a market for the dried skin of coffee cherry, which can be used to make a faintly fruity herbal tea known as cascara. When her father died, she inherited control over a low-lying farm near Santa Ana; she’ll have to find a way to keep the plants healthy without obsessing over them, since they will never produce great coffee. She has also gone into business as a consultant to her mill, J. Hill. The idea is to help other local producers make exceptional coffee, and to capture some of the value that her name has acquired: beans that meet her standards are stamped “Aida Batlle Selection,” and they command a significant premium.\n\n\n\nOne weekend in July, Batlle flew to Minneapolis to meet with some of the executives at Caribou, a coffee chain that buys Aida Batlle Selection. There are about six hundred Caribou cafés, mainly in the Midwest, and the company prides itself on being smaller and friendlier than Starbucks. Batlle was accompanied by executives from J. Hill as well as an elegant older Salvadoran couple, producers from the A.B.S. program. The group, which resembled a diplomatic delegation, was taken to a series of Caribou locations in Minneapolis’s labyrinthine downtown shopping center. Batlle had put on a crisp white shirt, tan slacks, and leather loafers—she looked very Miami. Many of the cafés were serving an A.B.S. coffee from a farm called El Majahual, which was given a brief description on one Caribou blackboard: “lighter roast: cherry \u002F creamy \u002F semisweet.” Batlle didn’t frown when she took her first sip, and she liked the way it sweetened as it cooled. \n\n\n\nIt was tantalizingly easy: you could walk into a mall, order a small black coffee, and be handed a drink that hadn’t entirely forgotten its past life as a fruit. Batlle lives in a world where exceptional coffee is the norm, but even now, amid the third-wave boom, the coffee that most people drink has little in common with the beverage that Batlle loves. Could big chains and small delis produce something to her liking, and do it consistently? Would their customers want them to? And if gently roasted, carefully brewed, high-elevation, single-origin coffee became the norm would the coffee evangelists applaud? Or would they find some way to call it swill? ♦","canonicalUrl":"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fmagazine\u002F2011\u002F11\u002F21\u002Fsacred-grounds","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c95ee7fe02cbd16335e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Agriculture","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"agriculture"},{"id":"5c2e1fed41c92e2c9b85dcc4","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Beverages","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"beverages"},{"id":"5c2e1c7c2710c62d10815412","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Business","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"business"},{"id":"5c2e1ff201de442c9e3e60bb","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Caffeine","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"caffeine"},{"id":"5c2e1d3481ab3335f580f206","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Coca-Cola","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"coca-cola"},{"id":"5c2e1ce681ab3335f580f1f2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Coffee","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"coffee"},{"id":"5c2e1fb741c92e2c9b85dca0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Drinks","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"drinks"},{"id":"5c2e1d4a7e716b454591ae79","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"El Salvador","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"el-salvador"},{"id":"5c2e1ce6ee7fe02cbd1633c2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Espresso","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"espresso"},{"id":"5c2e1d3941c92e2c9b85daca","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Farmers","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"farmers"},{"id":"5c2e1c79ee7fe02cbd163329","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Food","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"food"},{"id":"5c2e1ce7e56e652c9027470a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Fruit","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"fruit"},{"id":"5c2e1ff201de442c9e3e60bc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Soft Drinks","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"soft-drinks"},{"id":"5c2e1dac7e716b454591aed8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Starbucks","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"starbucks"}],"sections":[{"id":"59111e2776b9ca4b4bbd09d3","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Letter from El Salvador","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"letter-from-el-salvador"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909fe782179605b11ad991c","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Kelefa Sanneh has contributed to *The New Yorker* since 2001 and has been a staff writer since 2008.
